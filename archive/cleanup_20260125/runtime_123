next I need the same script, but for me to physicall run. 
This one will push to github. 
in system/git_machine.sh is an old version. Keep the humor and comments the same but inject new logic. 
1. Stops the mainframe and forge. 
2. Runs the same ci/cd pipeline, but pushes to github. 
3. Give me a clean local repo, no open branches. 
4. Asks me what the next branch to open is, and does that. 
!!!!! Local repo is always truth. Github is just a backup
