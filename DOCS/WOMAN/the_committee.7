NAME
       the_committee - The Bicameral Protocol Governance Body

SYNOPSIS
       python3 DOCS/RFC/committee.py

DESCRIPTION
       The  Bicameral Committee is the governing body responsible for the rati-
       fication and oversight of AnvilOS Protocols (RFCs). It ensures that all
       system  changes  adhere  to "The Law" and maintains a permanent audit log
        of governance sessions in the Cortex.

PARTICIPANTS
       The Committee requires a quorum of three distinct entities:

       CHAIRMAN ($meat)
              The  Human  Authority  (bigiron).  Holds  final veto power over
              all protocol ratifications.

       VICE-CHAIR ($aimeat)
              The Autonomous Interface. Responsible for technical  feasibility
              assessment and implementation of directives.

       OBSERVER ($thespy)
              A passive monitoring entity. Ensures transparency and logs com-
              mittee actions to the persistent telemetry stream.

FUNCTIONS
       1. QUORUM LOGGING
          Every  time the Committee convenes, a "QUORUM_CALLED" event is logged
          to the `committee_log` table and mirrored to the  `live_stream`.  This
          creates an immutable record of system governance.

       2. RFC DOCKET SCAN
          The Committee automatically scans `DOCS/RFC/` for files  with  STATUS:
          DRAFT  or  STATUS: PENDING. These represent proposed changes to system
          logic or "The Law" that await ratification.

       3. AGENT STATUS MONITORING
          The Committee verifies the health and connectivity  of  the  Vice-Chair
          (AIMEAT) to ensure the technical interface is responsive.
