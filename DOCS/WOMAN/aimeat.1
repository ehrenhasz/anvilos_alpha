AIMEAT(1)                 AnvilOS System Manual                 AIMEAT(1)

NAME
       aimeat - The Autonomous Interface for Manufacturing & Engineering Agent
       Technologies

SYNOPSIS
       python3 aimeat.py
       @aimeat> [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       AIMEAT is the primary CLI agent for AnvilOS. It is "Schema Aware," mean-
       ing it inspects the `cortex.db` structure on boot to ensure compatibility
       with the Mainframe.

       It serves as the injection point for human intent, translating natural
       language or predefined directives into `sys_goals` for The Forge.

COMMANDS
       start [cards] | forge
              Triggers the "Mass Injection" sequence.
              1. Reads `forge_directives.py` (The Manifest).
              2. Connects to `data/cortex.db`.
              3. Injects high-level Goals into `sys_goals`.
              4. The Architect Daemon then picks these up to forge Cards.

       help
              Displays the agent's capabilities and available tools.

       exit | quit
              Terminates the AIMEAT session.

       [Natural Language]
              Any other input is treated as a prompt for the Gemini 2.0 Flash
              model. AIMEAT can:
              - Read/Write files.
              - Execute shell commands.
              - Query the database.
              - Modify the system.

ENVIRONMENT
       PYTHONPATH
              Must include `.` and `vendor/` to locate dependencies.

       GOOGLE_API_KEY
              Required for the Gemini 2.0 Flash backend. Loaded from
              `config/token`.

FILES
       aimeat.py
              The agent entry point.

       forge_directives.py
              The source of truth for the `start` command. Contains the list
              of Phase 2 build objectives.

       data/cortex.db
              The brain. AIMEAT writes to `sys_goals` and `chat_outbox`.

HISTORY
       AIMEAT was forged to replace the deprecated "Supervisor" script. It rep-
       resents the shift from imperative scripting to autonomous agency.
