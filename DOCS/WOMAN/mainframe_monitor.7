MAINFRAME_MONITOR(7)      AnvilOS System Manual      MAINFRAME_MONITOR(7)

NAME
       mainframe_monitor - The Eye of the Cortex

SYNOPSIS
       python3 src/anvilos/mainframe_monitor.py

DESCRIPTION
       The  Mainframe Monitor is the primary visual interface for the AnvilOS
       Forge. It provides real-time telemetry, queue status, and  direct  con-
       trol over the Sovereign Build Daemons (The Forge and The Processor).

       It  adheres  to the "Pride in the Machine" aesthetic: High contrast,
       neon, and minimal greyscale.

INTERFACE
       The screen is divided into three sections:

       1. HEADER
          Displays the project name ("ANVILOS_ALPHA"), interface title,  and
          current system time.

       2. BODY
          - Left Panel (Instruction Stack): Shows the active card queue.
            - SEQ: Sequence number.
            - ID:  Unique Card UUID (first 8 chars).
            - OP:  Operation Code (SYS_CMD, FILE_WRITE, etc).
            - PLD: Payload preview.
            - STATUS: PENDING (Blue), PROCESSING (Yellow), PUNCHED (Green).

          - Right Panel (System Telemetry):
            - SYSTEM STATUS: ONLINE, OFFLINE (Red), or DEGRADED (Yellow).
            - Card Counts: Total, Pending, Processing, Punched, Jammed.
            - Completion %: Progress of the current stack.

       3. FOOTER
          Contains the Control Deck and the Status Message.

CONTROLS
       The Monitor captures function keys (and number keys 1-5) to issue com-
       mands to the daemons.

       F1 / 1  START
               Ignites the Forge. Starts both `architect_daemon.py` and `pro-
               cessor_daemon.py` if they are not running.

       F2 / 2  STOP
               Halts the Forge. Sends SIGTERM/SIGKILL to both daemons.

       F3 / 3  RESET
               Reboots the Forge. Kills running daemons, waits 0.5s,  and
               re-spawns them. Use this if the stack is stuck.

       F4 / 4  SORT
               Re-indexes the Card Stack. Useful if sequence numbers  become
               disordered due to manual injection.

       F5 / 5  ARCHIVE
               The  "Flush"  command. Moves ALL cards (Pending, Punched, Jammed)
               from the active `card_stack` to `data/card_archive.json`  and
               clears the queue. Use with caution.

       ESC     QUIT
               Exits the Monitor interface. Does NOT stop the daemons.

MATRIX MODE
       The Monitor is integrated with the `matrix.py` stream visualization.
       (See matrix(1) for standalone usage).

       To launch the standalone code stream:
       $ python3 matrix.py

       Controls:
       SPACE   Pause/Resume scrolling.

FILES
       src/anvilos/mainframe_monitor.py
              The executable source.

       data/cortex.db
              The SQLite database accessed for telemetry.
