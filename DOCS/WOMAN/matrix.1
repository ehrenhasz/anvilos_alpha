MATRIX(1)                   AnvilOS System Manual                   MATRIX(1)

NAME
       matrix - The Pride in the Machine Visualizer

SYNOPSIS
       python3 matrix.py

DESCRIPTION
       The  Matrix is the primary visualizer for the AnvilOS Sovereign Build Sys-
       tem. It renders a real-time, scrolling stream of newly  forged  artifacts,
       providing immediate visual confirmation of system activity.

       It adheres to the "Pride in the Machine" aesthetic, utilizing a vibrant,
       neon-rainbow palette to distinguish file types and content.

MODES OF OPERATION
       1. SCAN
          Continuously  watches  `src/native/`, `build_artifacts/`, and `tests/
          anvil/` for new files matching:
          - `.anv` (Anvil Bytecode)
          - `.json` (MicroJSON Sidecars)
          - `.mpy` (Compiled MicroPython)
          - `.c`, `.rs`, `.h` (Native Source)

       2. INGEST
          When a new file is detected (or modified), its content is read  and
          colored  line-by-line.  To preserve memory, ingestion is capped at 100
          lines per file.

       3. STREAM
          The content buffer is scrolled vertically. If no new files appear, the
          buffer loops to maintain the visual flow ("The Pulse").

CONTROLS
       SPACE   Pause / Resume
               Toggles the scrolling. When paused, a red "PAUSED" indicator ap-
               pears in the header.

       Ctrl+C  Disconnect
               Terminates the Matrix stream cleanly.

CONFIGURATION
       The  script  is  configurable via variables at the top of `matrix.py`. You
       can adjust:
       - ARTIFACT_DIRS: Directories to scan.
       - EXTENSIONS: File types to display.
       - COLORS: The neon palette used for syntax highlighting.

FILES
