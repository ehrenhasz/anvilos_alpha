GIT_MANUAL(1)               AnvilOS System Manual               GIT_MANUAL(1)

NAME
       git_manual - The Git Control Center (Sovereign Gate)

SYNOPSIS
       ./git_manual.sh

DESCRIPTION
       git_manual.sh  is  the  authoritative  interface  for managing the AnvilOS
       source repository. It provides a menu-driven wrapper around  git(1)  with
       integrated recovery logic for common failures.

       This  script  is  the ONLY authorized way to synchronize code with remote
       endpoints (GitHub).

CLASSIFICATION: RESTRICTED
       This  script  is  OFF-LIMITS  to  all  AI  Agents  (AIMEAT,  FORGE,  etc).
       Modification  or  execution  by non-human entities is a violation of The
       Collar. Only The Commander may trigger pushes to GitHub.

CONTROLS
       1. Git Add
          Stages all local changes (`git add . --verbose`).

       2. Git Commit
          Prompts for a message and commits staged changes.

       3. Git Push
          Standard upload to the configured remote (`origin/main`).

       4. Git Push FORCE
          Overwrites remote history with local. Use only in catastrophic cases.

       5. Git Merge
          Merges another branch into the current one.

       6. Git Clean
          Nukes all untracked files. DANGER: IRREVERSIBLE.

       7. New Branch
          Creates and switches to a new local branch.

       8. Status Check
          Displays current repo state.

       9. Manual Deep Reset
          Resets local history to match remote while keeping file changes.

INTELLIGENT RECOVERY
       The  script  monitors  push  failures.  If  a  push is rejected due to file
       size limits (GitHub's 100MB cap), the script enters DEEP CLEAN mode:
       1. Soft resets to origin.
       2. Identifies and unstages the offending large files.
       3. Appends large files to `.gitignore`.
       4. Re-commits the clean state.

FILES
       git_manual.sh
              The main control script.

       .gitignore
              Modified automatically during Deep Clean recovery.
