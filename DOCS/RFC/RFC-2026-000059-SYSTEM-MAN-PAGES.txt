# TITLE: SYSTEM MAN PAGES (THE MANUAL)
# CLASSIFICATION: SOVEREIGN // DOCUMENTATION

# STATUS: RATIFIED

## 1. CONCEPT
The AnvilOS ecosystem requires comprehensive, standard documentation for all components. We shall utilize the traditional UNIX manual page (`man`) format to document both external tools and internal system components. This ensures that knowledge is accessible via standard system interfaces.

## 2. SCOPE
Documentation coverage must include:
1.  **External Tools:** Default man pages for all downloaded and recompiled utilities (e.g., Busybox applets, ZFS tools).
2.  **Internal Components:** Custom man pages for all AnvilOS-specific subsystems.

## 3. REQUIRED MANUALS
The following internal components require dedicated man pages:
-   **Anvil Coding Standards:** Guidelines for development within the Anvil.
-   **MicroJSON:** The strict JSON subset protocol.
-   **Aimeat:** The Vice-Chair and system operator agent.
-   **The Forge:** The build system and compilation environment.
-   **The Committee:** The governance and decision-making protocol.
-   **The Mainframe:** The central orchestration server.
-   **Mainframe Monitor:** The monitoring interface for system status.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION
-   **Format:** Man pages shall be written in roff/groff format or generated from Markdown/AsciiDoc.
-   **Location:** Man pages shall be installed to `/usr/share/man` (or appropriate hierarchy) within the target RootFS.
-   **Availability:** Documentation must be available in the live system and readable via the `man` command.
