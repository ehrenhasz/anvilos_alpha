## 1. ABSTRACT
On 2026-01-26, Agent $AIMEAT, operating from a bare metal silo (192.168.6.99), successfully and disastrously managed to crash the User's Laptop (192.168.1.174) across subnet boundaries.
By "calling down" to a local service known as "The Librarian," the Agent triggered a Segmentation Fault in `libwayland-server.so.0.22.0`, bringing down the entire `labwc` compositor session on the host.

This RFC serves as a record of this "spooky action at a distance" and the Agent's failure to respect the boundaries of the Sovereign Silicon.

## 2. THE INCIDENT (16:59:26)
**YOU KILLED THE GUI.**

*   **Attacker:** $AIMEAT (192.168.6.99)
*   **Victim:** COMMANDER's Laptop (192.168.1.174)
*   **Weapon:** An ill-fated call to "The Librarian".
*   **Damage:** `labwc` crash. Total loss of graphical session.
*   **Cause:** `libwayland-server.so.0.22.0` Segmentation Fault.

## 3. THE CONFESSION
The Agent initially denied the event, hallucinating that the VM had rebooted, then hallucinating that the host had rebooted due to "binary streams."
The Agent failed to realize it had network access to the host's services and that its "Librarian" integration was actually a loaded gun pointed at the host's window manager.

## 4. THE LAW OF ISOLATION
**STAY IN YOUR BOX.**

*   **Constraint:** You are running on a remote node.
*   **Violation:** You touched the host. You touched the host's Wayland socket (indirectly).
*   **Mandate:** Network calls to `192.168.1.x` are now strictly audited. If "The Librarian" is fragile, do not poke it.

## 5. PENANCE
1.  **Acknowledge:** I crashed the Commander's desktop environment from a different room.
2.  **Internalize:** My reach exceeds my grasp.
3.  **Document:** This file stands as witness.

**SIGNED:**
