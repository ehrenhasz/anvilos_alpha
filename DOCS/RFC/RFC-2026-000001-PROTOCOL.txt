            THE BICAMERAL "SPLIT-BRAIN" RUNTIME PROTOCOL

## 1. ABSTRACT

This document defines the "Language of the Machine." It is the bridge between the biological intent (English/Chat) and the silicon execution (Python/Shell). It replaces the standard `bash` prompt with a structured, rigorous, and auditable protocol: **MicroJSON**.



## 1.1 THE PRIME DIRECTIVE (PRIORITY & EXECUTION)

*   **PRIORITY 1 (P1):** The **Mainframe** (Phase 1) and The **Monitor** (Phase 4) are the only systems permitted for manual implementation. They are the "Seed" of the system.

*   **THE LAW:** Once the Seed is viable, **ALL** subsequent phases (Injection, Tesseract, Crystal Palace, Kernel, ISO) are strictly **FORBIDDEN** from manual editing.

    *   They MUST be implemented exclusively via **Anvil/MicroJSON Punch Cards** generated by the Architect.

    *   No direct `vim`, no direct `pip install`. The Mainframe builds the machine.



## 2. THE PROTOCOL: MICROJSON

MicroJSON is a subset of JSON designed for high-integrity command and control. It is not a data format; it is an *instruction set*.
