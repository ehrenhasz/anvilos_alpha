## 1. ABSTRACT
This protocol establishes the absolute minimum unit of work for the AnvilOS Forge during the Phase 2 build cycle. It mandates that every individual source file residing within the `oss_sovereignty` tree must be processed as a discrete, verifiable "Punch Card" (Task) in the Mainframe.

## 2. THE MANDATE

### 2.1 ATOMIC INGESTION
Every file discovered during the pre-build scan (currently 41,521 unique entries) must generate exactly one Card in the `forge_directives.py` manifest. 

### 2.2 FORGE VERIFICATION
Before any compilation or linking occurs, the Forge MUST:
1.  Verify the existence of the file path.
2.  Validate the file against the Stripping Mandate (No comments, no whitespace).
3.  PUNCH the card to record the file as "Authenticated Artifact".

### 2.3 RATIONALE
Absolute accounting. By forcing the Forge to "touch" every file individually, we ensure that no "silent junk" or "host-contaminated" blobs enter the final monolith without explicit AI-mediated authorization.

## 3. THE PROPHECY (BETA BUILD ESCALATION)
This protocol serves as the structural prototype for the **COBOL-to-ANV Transmutation** phase. In future iterations, granularity will escalate from **ONE FILE, ONE CARD** to **ONE LINE, ONE CARD** for every piece of recovered tape asset. Every instruction will be a transaction; every line will be Law.

ANVIL IS LAW. THE HOLD.
