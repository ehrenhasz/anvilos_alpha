 I need the matrix display. All output from the mainframe is doing, from it's DB entries. I want to see a bottom up scroll of all *.anv and microjson files coming out of the anvil. Keep loopting what you have, and add more as it comes in. not too fast. a give line takes 3 seconds to go from bottom to top. And make it gay, I want color coding, minimal white and grey
