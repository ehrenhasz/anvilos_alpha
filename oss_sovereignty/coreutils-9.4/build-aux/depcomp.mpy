Having to rename by hand is ugly.\n##   (We might end up doing this anyway to support other compilers.)\n## - The DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT environment variable makes gcc act like\n##   -MM, not -M (despite what the docs say).  Also, it might not be\n##   supported by the other compilers which use the 'gcc' depmode.\n## - Using -M directly means running the compiler twice (even worse\n##   than renaming).\n  if test -z \"$gccflag\"; then\n    gccflag=-MD,\n  fi\n  \"$@\" -Wp,\"$gccflag$tmpdepfile\"\n  stat=$?\n  if test $stat -ne 0; then\n    rm -f \"$tmpdepfile\"\n    exit $stat\n  fi\n  rm -f \"$depfile\"\n  echo \"$object : \\\\\" > \"$depfile\"\n  # The second -e expression handles DOS-style file names with drive\n  # letters.\n  sed -e 's/^[^:]*: / /' \\\n      -e 's/^['$alpha']:\\/[^:]*: / /' < \"$tmpdepfile\" >> \"$depfile\"\n## This next piece of magic avoids the \"deleted header file\" problem.\n## The problem is that when a header file which appears in a .P file\n## is deleted, the dependency causes make to die (because there is\n## typically no way to rebuild the header).  We avoid this by adding\n## dummy dependencies for each header file.  Too bad gcc doesn't do\n## this for us directly.\n## Some versions of gcc put a space before the ':'.  On the theory\n## that the space means something, we add a space to the output as\n## well.  hp depmode also adds that space, but also prefixes the VPATH\n## to the object.
