[\\fI\\,OWNER\\/\\fR][\\fI\\,:\\/\\fR[\\fI\\,GROUP\\/\\fR]] \\fI\\,FILE\\/\\fR...\n.br\n.B chown\n[\\fI\\,OPTION\\/\\fR]... \\fI\\,--reference=RFILE FILE\\/\\fR...\n.SH DESCRIPTION\nThis manual page\ndocuments the GNU version of\n.BR chown .\n.B chown\nchanges the user and/or group ownership of each given file.  If\nonly an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that user is made the\nowner of each given file, and the files' group is not changed.  If the\nowner is followed by a colon and a group name (or numeric group ID),\nwith no spaces between them, the group ownership of the files is\nchanged as well.  If a colon but no group name follows the user name,\nthat user is made the owner of the files and the group of the files is\nchanged to that user's login group.  If the colon and group are given,\nbut the owner is omitted, only the group of the files is changed;\nin this case,\n.B chown\nperforms the same function as\n.BR chgrp .\nIf only a colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither the\nowner nor the group is changed.\n.SH OPTIONS\n.PP\nChange the owner and/or group of each FILE to OWNER and/or GROUP.\nWith \\fB\\-\\-reference\\fR, change the owner and group of each FILE to those of RFILE.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-c\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-changes\\fR\nlike verbose but report only when a change is made\n.TP\n\\fB\\-f\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-silent\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-quiet\\fR\nsuppress most error messages\n.TP\n\\fB\\-v\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-verbose\\fR\noutput a diagnostic for every file processed\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-dereference\\fR\naffect the referent of each symbolic link (this is\nthe default), rather than the symbolic link itself\n.TP\n\\fB\\-h\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-no\\-dereference\\fR\naffect symbolic links instead of any referenced file\n(useful only on systems that can change the\nownership of a symlink)\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-from\\fR=\\fI\\,CURRENT_OWNER\\/\\fR:CURRENT_GROUP\nchange the owner and/or group of each file only if\nits current owner and/or group match those specified\nhere.  Either may be omitted, in which case a match\nis not required for the omitted attribute\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-no\\-preserve\\-root\\fR\ndo not treat '/' specially (the default)\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-preserve\\-root\\fR\nfail to operate recursively on '/'\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-reference\\fR=\\fI\\,RFILE\\/\\fR\nuse RFILE's owner and group rather than specifying\nOWNER:GROUP values.  RFILE is always dereferenced.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-R\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-recursive\\fR\noperate on files and directories recursively\n.PP\nThe following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the \\fB\\-R\\fR\noption is also specified.  If more than one is specified, only the final\none takes effect.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-H\\fR\nif a command line argument is a symbolic link\nto a directory, traverse it\n.TP\n\\fB\\-L\\fR\ntraverse every symbolic link to a directory\nencountered\n.TP\n\\fB\\-P\\fR\ndo not traverse any symbolic links (default)\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-help\\fR\ndisplay this help and exit\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-version\\fR\noutput version information and exit\n.PP\nOwner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed\nto login group if implied by a ':' following a symbolic OWNER.\nOWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as symbolic.\n.SH EXAMPLES\n.TP\nchown root /u\nChange the owner of /u to \"root\".\n.TP\nchown root:staff /u\nLikewise, but also change its group to \"staff\".\n.TP\nchown \\-hR root /u\nChange the owner of /u and subfiles to \"root\".\n.SH AUTHOR\nWritten by David MacKenzie and Jim Meyering.\n.SH \"REPORTING BUGS\"\nGNU coreutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>\n.br\nReport any translation bugs to <https://translationproject.org/team/>\n.SH COPYRIGHT\nCopyright \\(co 2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\n.br\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n.SH \"SEE ALSO\"\n\\fBchown\\fP(2)\n.PP\n.br\nFull documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/chown>\n.br\nor available locally via: info \\(aq(coreutils) chown invocation\\(aq\n",
