If none of these are given,\nthe effect is as if (\\fBa\\fP) were\ngiven, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.\n.PP\nThe operator \\fB+\\fP causes the selected file mode bits to be added to\nthe existing file mode bits of each file; \\fB-\\fP causes them to be\nremoved; and \\fB=\\fP causes them to be added and causes unmentioned\nbits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and\ngroup ID bits are not affected.\n.PP\nThe letters \\fBrwxXst\\fP select file mode bits for the affected users:\nread (\\fBr\\fP), write (\\fBw\\fP), execute (or search for directories)\n(\\fBx\\fP), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already\nhas execute permission for some user (\\fBX\\fP), set user or group ID\non execution (\\fBs\\fP), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit\n(\\fBt\\fP).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify\nexactly one of the letters \\fBugo\\fP: the permissions granted to the\nuser who owns the file (\\fBu\\fP), the permissions granted to other\nusers who are members of the file's group (\\fBg\\fP),\nand the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding\ncategories (\\fBo\\fP).\n.PP\nA numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0\\-7), derived by\nadding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are\nassumed to be leading zeros.\nThe first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and\nrestricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit\nselects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2),\nand execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users in the\nfile's group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not\nin the file's group, with the same values.\n.PP\n.B chmod\nnever changes the permissions of symbolic links; the\n.B chmod\nsystem call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem\nsince the permissions of symbolic links are never used.\nHowever, for each symbolic link listed on the command line,\n.B chmod\nchanges the permissions of the pointed-to file.\nIn contrast,\n.B chmod\nignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory\ntraversals.\n.SH \"SETUID AND SETGID BITS\"\n.B chmod\nclears the set-group-ID bit of a\nregular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's\neffective group ID or one of the user's supplementary group IDs,\nunless the user has appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions\nmay cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of\n.I MODE\nor\n.I RFILE\nto be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and\nfunctionality of the underlying\n.B chmod\nsystem call.  When in\ndoubt, check the underlying system behavior.\n.PP\nFor directories\n.B chmod\npreserves set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you\nexplicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or clear the bits with\nsymbolic modes like\n.B u+s\nand\n.BR g\\-s .\nTo clear these bits for directories with a numeric mode requires\nan additional leading zero like\n.BR 00755 ,\nleading minus like\n.BR \\-6000 ,\nor leading equals like\n.BR =755 .\n.SH \"RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT\"\nThe restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose\ninterpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it prevents\nunprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory\nunless they own the file or the directory; this is called the\n.I \"restricted deletion flag\"\nfor the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories\nlike \\fB/tmp\\fP.  For regular files on some older systems, the bit\nsaves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more\nquickly when run; this is called the\n.IR \"sticky bit\" .\n.SH OPTIONS\n.PP\nChange the mode of each FILE to MODE.\nWith \\fB\\-\\-reference\\fR, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-c\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-changes\\fR\nlike verbose but report only when a change is made\n.TP\n\\fB\\-f\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-silent\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-quiet\\fR\nsuppress most error messages\n.TP\n\\fB\\-v\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-verbose\\fR\noutput a diagnostic for every file processed\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-no\\-preserve\\-root\\fR\ndo not treat '/' specially (the default)\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-preserve\\-root\\fR\nfail to operate recursively on '/'\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-reference\\fR=\\fI\\,RFILE\\/\\fR\nuse RFILE's mode instead of specifying MODE values.\nRFILE is always dereferenced if a symbolic link.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-R\\fR, \\fB\\-\\-recursive\\fR\nchange files and directories recursively\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-help\\fR\ndisplay this help and exit\n.TP\n\\fB\\-\\-version\\fR\noutput version information and exit\n.PP\nEach MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([\\-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[\\-+=][0\\-7]+'.\n.SH AUTHOR\nWritten by David MacKenzie and Jim Meyering.\n.SH \"REPORTING BUGS\"\nGNU coreutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>\n.br\nReport any translation bugs to <https://translationproject.org/team/>\n.SH COPYRIGHT\nCopyright \\(co 2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\n.br\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n.SH \"SEE ALSO\"\n\\fBchmod\\fP(2)\n.PP\n.br\nFull documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/chmod>\n.br\nor available locally via: info \\(aq(coreutils) chmod invocation\\(aq\n",
