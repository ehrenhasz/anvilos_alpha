It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each flit is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four fits, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI speed (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the transfers here refer to fits.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 flit at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as data bandwidth.  For example, when we are transferring a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual data and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate data bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.; Number of non-NULL non-data flits transmitted across QPI.  This basically tracks the protocol overhead on the QPI link.  One can get a good picture of the QPI-link characteristics by evaluating the protocol flits, data flits, and idle/null flits.
