Generally reads to an open page are issued ahead of requests to closed pages.  This improves the page hit rate of the system.  However, high priority requests can cause pages of active requests to be closed in order to get them out.  This will reduce the latency of the high-priority request at the expense of lower bandwidth and increased overall average latency.\",\n        \"UMask\": \"0x2\",\n        \"Unit\": \"iMC\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"BriefDescription\": \"DRAM Precharge commands.; Precharge due to timer expiration\",\n        \"EventCode\": \"0x2\",\n        \"EventName\": \"UNC_M_PRE_COUNT.PAGE_CLOSE\",\n        \"PerPkg\": \"1\",\n        \"PublicDescription\": \"Counts the number of DRAM Precharge commands sent on this channel.\",\n        \"UMask\": \"0x2\",\n        \"Unit\": \"iMC\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"BriefDescription\": \"DRAM Precharge commands.; Precharges due to page miss\",\n        \"EventCode\": \"0x2\",\n        \"EventName\": \"UNC_M_PRE_COUNT.PAGE_MISS\",\n        \"PerPkg\": \"1\",\n        \"PublicDescription\": \"Counts the number of DRAM Precharge commands sent on this channel.\",\n        \"UMask\": \"0x1\",\n        \"Unit\": \"iMC\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"BriefDescription\": \"Read Pending Queue Full Cycles\",\n        \"EventCode\": \"0x12\",\n        \"EventName\": \"UNC_M_RPQ_CYCLES_FULL\",\n        \"PerPkg\": \"1\",\n        \"PublicDescription\": \"Counts the number of cycles when the Read Pending Queue is full.
