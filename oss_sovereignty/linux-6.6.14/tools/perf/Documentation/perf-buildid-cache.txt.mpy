It can add, remove, update and purge\nfiles to/from the cache. In the future it should as well set upper limits for\nthe space used by the cache, etc.\nThis also scans the target binary for SDT (Statically Defined Tracing) and\nrecord it along with the buildid-cache, which will be used by perf-probe.\nFor more details, see linkperf:perf-probe[1].\n\nOPTIONS\n-------\n-a::\n--add=::\n        Add specified file to the cache.\n-f::\n--force::\n\tDon't complain, do it.\n-k::\n--kcore::\n        Add specified kcore file to the cache. For the current host that is\n        /proc/kcore which requires root permissions to read. Be aware that\n        running 'perf buildid-cache' as root may update root's build-id cache\n        not the user's. Use the -v option to see where the file is created.\n        Note that the copied file contains only code sections not the whole core\n        image. Note also that files \"kallsyms\" and \"modules\" must also be in the\n        same directory and are also copied.  All 3 files are created with read\n        permissions for root only. kcore will not be added if there is already a\n        kcore in the cache (with the same build-id) that has the same modules at\n        the same addresses. Use the -v option to see if a copy of kcore is\n        actually made.\n-r::\n--remove=::\n        Remove a cached binary which has same build-id of specified file\n        from the cache.\n-p::\n--purge=::\n        Purge all cached binaries including older caches which have specified\n\tpath from the cache.\n-P::\n--purge-all::\n\tPurge all cached binaries. This will flush out entire cache.\n-M::\n--missing=::\n\tList missing build ids in the cache for the specified file.\n-u::\n--update=::\n\tUpdate specified file of the cache. Note that this doesn't remove\n\tolder entries since those may be still needed for annotating old\n\t(or remote) perf.data. Only if there is already a cache which has\n\texactly same build-id, that is replaced by new one. It can be used\n\tto update kallsyms and kernel dso to vmlinux in order to support\n\tannotation.\n-l::\n--list::\n\tList all valid binaries from cache.\n-v::\n--verbose::\n\tBe more verbose.\n\n--target-ns=PID:\n\tObtain mount namespace information from the target pid.  This is\n\tused when creating a uprobe for a process that resides in a\n\tdifferent mount namespace from the perf(1) utility.\n\n--debuginfod[=URLs]::\n\tSpecify debuginfod URL to be used when retrieving perf.data binaries,\n\tit follows the same syntax as the DEBUGINFOD_URLS variable, like:\n\n\t  buildid-cache.debuginfod=http://192.168.122.174:8002\n\n\tIf the URLs is not specified, the value of DEBUGINFOD_URLS\n\tsystem environment variable is used.\n\nSEE ALSO\n--------\nlinkperf:perf-record[1], linkperf:perf-report[1], linkperf:perf-buildid-list[1]\n",
