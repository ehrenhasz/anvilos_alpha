(this is done by starting up mockup threads\n  that mimic the workload based on the events in the trace. These\n  threads can then replay the timings (CPU runtime and sleep patterns)\n  of the workload as it occurred when it was recorded - and can repeat\n  it a number of times, measuring its performance.)\n\n  'perf sched map' to print a textual context-switching outline of\n  workload captured via perf sched record.  Columns stand for\n  individual CPUs, and the two-letter shortcuts stand for tasks that\n  are running on a CPU. A '*' denotes the CPU that had the event, and\n  a dot signals an idle CPU.\n\n  'perf sched timehist' provides an analysis of scheduling events.\n    \n    Example usage:\n        perf sched record -- sleep 1\n        perf sched timehist\n    \n   By default it shows the individual schedule events, including the wait\n   time (time between sched-out and next sched-in events for the task), the\n   task scheduling delay (time between wakeup and actually running) and run\n   time for the task:\n    \n                time    cpu  task name             wait time  sch delay   run time\n                             [tid/pid]                (msec)     (msec)     (msec)\n      -------------- ------  --------------------  ---------  ---------  ---------\n        79371.874569 [0011]  gcc[31949]                0.014      0.000      1.148\n        79371.874591 [0010]  gcc[31951]                0.000      0.000      0.024\n        79371.874603 [0010]  migration/10[59]          3.350      0.004      0.011\n        79371.874604 [0011]  <idle>                    1.148      0.000      0.035\n        79371.874723 [0005]  <idle>                    0.016      0.000      1.383\n        79371.874746 [0005]  gcc[31949]                0.153      0.078      0.022\n    ...\n    \n   Times are in msec.usec.\n\nOPTIONS\n-------\n-i::\n--input=<file>::\n        Input file name.
