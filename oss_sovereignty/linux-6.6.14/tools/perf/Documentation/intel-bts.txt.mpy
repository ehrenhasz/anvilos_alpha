  "human_readable_source": "Intel Branch Trace Store\n========================\n\nOverview\n========\n\nIntel BTS could be regarded as a predecessor to Intel PT and has some\nsimilarities because it can also identify every branch a program takes.  A\nnotable difference is that Intel BTS has no timing information and as a\nconsequence the present implementation is limited to per-thread recording.\n\nWhile decoding Intel BTS does not require walking the object code, the object\ncode is still needed to pair up calls and returns correctly, consequently much\nof the Intel PT documentation applies also to Intel BTS.  Refer to the Intel PT\ndocumentation and consider that the PMU 'intel_bts' can usually be used in\nplace of 'intel_pt' in the examples provided, with the proviso that per-thread\nrecording must also be stipulated i.e. the --per-thread option for\n'perf record'.\n\n\nperf record\n===========\n\nnew event\n---------\n\nThe Intel BTS kernel driver creates a new PMU for Intel BTS.  The perf record\noption is:\n\n\t-e intel_bts//\n\nCurrently Intel BTS is limited to per-thread tracing so the --per-thread option\nis also needed.\n\n\nsnapshot option\n---------------\n\nThe snapshot option is the same as Intel PT (refer Intel PT documentation).\n\n\nauxtrace mmap size option\n-----------------------\n\nThe mmap size option is the same as Intel PT (refer Intel PT documentation).\n\n\nperf script\n===========\n\nBy default, perf script will decode trace data found in the perf.data file.\nThis can be further controlled by option --itrace.  The --itrace option is\nthe same as Intel PT (refer Intel PT documentation) except that neither\n\"instructions\" events nor \"transactions\" events (and consequently call\nchains) are supported.\n\nTo disable trace decoding entirely, use the option --no-itrace.\n\n\ndump option\n-----------\n\nperf script has an option (-D) to \"dump\" the events i.e. display the binary\ndata.\n\nWhen -D is used, Intel BTS packets are displayed.\n\nTo disable the display of Intel BTS packets, combine the -D option with\n--no-itrace.\n\n\nperf report\n===========\n\nBy default, perf report will decode trace data found in the perf.data file.\nThis can be further controlled by new option --itrace exactly the same as\nperf script.\n\n\nperf inject\n===========\n\nperf inject also accepts the --itrace option in which case tracing data is\nremoved and replaced with the synthesized events. e.g.\n\n\tperf inject --itrace -i perf.data -o perf.data.new\n",
