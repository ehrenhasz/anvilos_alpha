Note that options are case-sensitive.\n.PP\n\\fB--add attributes\\fP add column with counter having specified 'attributes'.  The 'location' attribute is required, all others are optional.\n.nf\n\tlocation: {\\fBmsrDDD\\fP | \\fBmsr0xXXX\\fP | \\fB/sys/path...\\fP}\n\t\tmsrDDD is a decimal offset, eg. msr16\n\t\tmsr0xXXX is a hex offset, eg. msr0x10\n\t\t/sys/path... is an absolute path to a sysfs attribute\n\n\tscope: {\\fBcpu\\fP | \\fBcore\\fP | \\fBpackage\\fP}\n\t\tsample and print the counter for every cpu, core, or package.\n\t\tdefault: cpu\n\n\tsize: {\\fBu32\\fP | \\fBu64\\fP }\n\t\tMSRs are read as 64-bits, u32 truncates the displayed value to 32-bits.\n\t\tdefault: u64\n\n\tformat: {\\fBraw\\fP | \\fBdelta\\fP | \\fBpercent\\fP}\n\t\t'raw' shows the MSR contents in hex.\n\t\t'delta' shows the difference in values during the measurement interval.\n\t\t'percent' shows the delta as a percentage of the cycles elapsed.\n\t\tdefault: delta\n\n\tname: \"name_string\"\n\t\tAny string that does not match a key-word above is used\n\t\tas the column header.\n.fi\n.PP\n\\fB--cpu cpu-set\\fP limit output to system summary plus the specified cpu-set.  If cpu-set is the string \"core\", then the system summary plus the first CPU in each core are printed -- eg. subsequent HT siblings are not printed.  Or if cpu-set is the string \"package\", then the system summary plus the first CPU in each package is printed.  Otherwise, the system summary plus the specified set of CPUs are printed.  The cpu-set is ordered from low to high, comma delimited with \"..\" and \"-\" permitted to denote a range. eg. 1,2,8,14..17,21-44\n.PP\n\\fB--hide column\\fP do not show the specified built-in columns.  May be invoked multiple times, or with a comma-separated list of column names.\n.PP\n\\fB--enable column\\fP show the specified built-in columns, which are otherwise disabled, by default.  Currently the only built-in counters disabled by default are \"usec\", \"Time_Of_Day_Seconds\", \"APIC\" and \"X2APIC\".\nThe column name \"all\" can be used to enable all disabled-by-default built-in counters.\n.PP\n\\fB--show column\\fP show only the specified built-in columns.  May be invoked multiple times, or with a comma-separated list of column names.\n.PP\n\\fB--show CATEGORY --hide CATEGORY\\fP  Show and hide also accept a single CATEGORY of columns: \"all\", \"topology\", \"idle\", \"frequency\", \"power\", \"sysfs\", \"other\".\n.PP\n\\fB--Dump\\fP displays the raw counter values.\n.PP\n\\fB--quiet\\fP Do not decode and print the system configuration header information.\n.PP\n\\fB--interval seconds\\fP overrides the default 5.0 second measurement interval.\n.PP\n\\fB--num_iterations num\\fP number of the measurement iterations.\n.PP\n\\fB--out output_file\\fP turbostat output is written to the specified output_file.\nThe file is truncated if it already exists, and it is created if it does not exist.\n.PP\n\\fB--help\\fP displays usage for the most common parameters.\n.PP\n\\fB--Joules\\fP displays energy in Joules, rather than dividing Joules by time to print power in Watts.\n.PP\n\\fB--list\\fP display column header names available for use by --show and --hide, then exit.\n.PP\n\\fB--Summary\\fP limits output to a 1-line System Summary for each interval.\n.PP\n\\fB--TCC temperature\\fP sets the Thermal Control Circuit temperature for systems which do not export that value.  This is used for making sense of the Digital Thermal Sensor outputs, as they return degrees Celsius below the TCC activation temperature.\n.PP\n\\fB--version\\fP displays the version.\n.PP\nThe \\fBcommand\\fP parameter forks \\fBcommand\\fP, and upon its exit,\ndisplays the statistics gathered since it was forked.\n.PP\n.SH ROW DESCRIPTIONS\nThe system configuration dump (if --quiet is not used) is followed by statistics.  The first row of the statistics labels the content of each column (below).  The second row of statistics is the system summary line.  The system summary line has a '-' in the columns for the Package, Core, and CPU.  The contents of the system summary line depends on the type of column.  Columns that count items (eg. IRQ) show the sum across all CPUs in the system.  Columns that show a percentage show the average across all CPUs in the system.  Columns that dump raw MSR values simply show 0 in the summary.  After the system summary row, each row describes a specific Package/Core/CPU.  Note that if the --cpu parameter is used to limit which specific CPUs are displayed, turbostat will still collect statistics for all CPUs in the system and will still show the system summary for all CPUs in the system.\n.SH COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS\n.PP\n\\fBusec\\fP For each CPU, the number of microseconds elapsed during counter collection, including thread migration -- if any.  This counter is disabled by default, and is enabled with \"--enable usec\", or --debug.  On the summary row, usec refers to the total elapsed time to collect the counters on all cpus.\n.PP\n\\fBTime_Of_Day_Seconds\\fP For each CPU, the gettimeofday(2) value (seconds.subsec since Epoch) when the counters ending the measurement interval were collected.  This column is disabled by default, and can be enabled with \"--enable Time_Of_Day_Seconds\" or \"--debug\".  On the summary row, Time_Of_Day_Seconds refers to the timestamp following collection of counters on the last CPU.\n.PP\n\\fBCore\\fP processor core number.  Note that multiple CPUs per core indicate support for Intel(R) Hyper-Threading Technology (HT).\n.PP\n\\fBCPU\\fP Linux CPU (logical processor) number.  Yes, it is okay that on many systems the CPUs are not listed in numerical order -- for efficiency reasons, turbostat runs in topology order, so HT siblings appear together.\n.PP\n\\fBPackage\\fP processor package number -- not present on systems with a single processor package.\n.PP\n\\fBAvg_MHz\\fP number of cycles executed divided by time elapsed.  Note that this includes idle-time when 0 instructions are executed.\n.PP\n\\fBBusy%\\fP percent of the measurement interval that the CPU executes instructions, aka. % of time in \"C0\" state.\n.PP\n\\fBBzy_MHz\\fP average clock rate while the CPU was not idle (ie. in \"c0\" state).\n.PP\n\\fBTSC_MHz\\fP average MHz that the TSC ran during the entire interval.\n.PP\n\\fBIRQ\\fP The number of interrupts serviced by that CPU during the measurement interval.  The system total line is the sum of interrupts serviced across all CPUs.  turbostat parses /proc/interrupts to generate this summary.\n.PP\n\\fBSMI\\fP The number of System Management Interrupts  serviced CPU during the measurement interval.  While this counter is actually per-CPU, SMI are triggered on all processors, so the number should be the same for all CPUs.\n.PP\n\\fBC1, C2, C3...\\fP The number times Linux requested the C1, C2, C3 idle state during the measurement interval.  The system summary line shows the sum for all CPUs.  These are C-state names as exported in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/name.  While their names are generic, their attributes are processor specific. They the system description section of output shows what MWAIT sub-states they are mapped to on each system.\n.PP\n\\fBC1%, C2%, C3%\\fP The residency percentage that Linux requested C1, C2, C3....  The system summary is the average of all CPUs in the system.  Note that these are software, reflecting what was requested.  The hardware counters reflect what was actually achieved.\n.PP\n\\fBCPU%c1, CPU%c3, CPU%c6, CPU%c7\\fP show the percentage residency in hardware core idle states.  These numbers are from hardware residency counters.\n.PP\n\\fBCoreTmp\\fP Degrees Celsius reported by the per-core Digital Thermal Sensor.\n.PP\n\\fBPkgTmp\\fP Degrees Celsius reported by the per-package Package Thermal Monitor.\n.PP\n\\fBGFX%rc6\\fP The percentage of time the GPU is in the \"render C6\" state, rc6, during the measurement interval. From /sys/class/drm/card0/power/rc6_residency_ms.\n.PP\n\\fBGFXMHz\\fP Instantaneous snapshot of what sysfs presents at the end of the measurement interval. From /sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/drm/card0/gt_cur_freq_mhz.\n.PP\n\\fBPkg%pc2, Pkg%pc3, Pkg%pc6, Pkg%pc7\\fP percentage residency in hardware package idle states.  These numbers are from hardware residency counters.\n.PP\n\\fBPkgWatt\\fP Watts consumed by the whole package.\n.PP\n\\fBCorWatt\\fP Watts consumed by the core part of the package.\n.PP\n\\fBGFXWatt\\fP Watts consumed by the Graphics part of the package -- available only on client processors.\n.PP\n\\fBRAMWatt\\fP Watts consumed by the DRAM DIMMS -- available only on server processors.\n.PP\n\\fBPKG_%\\fP percent of the interval that RAPL throttling was active on the Package.  Note that the system summary is the sum of the package throttling time, and thus may be higher than 100% on a multi-package system.  Note that the meaning of this field is model specific.  For example, some hardware increments this counter when RAPL responds to thermal limits, but does not increment this counter when RAPL responds to power limits.  Comparing PkgWatt and PkgTmp to system limits is necessary.\n.PP\n\\fBRAM_%\\fP percent of the interval that RAPL throttling was active on DRAM.\n.PP\n\\fBUncMHz\\fP uncore MHz, instantaneous sample.\n.SH TOO MUCH INFORMATION EXAMPLE\nBy default, turbostat dumps all possible information -- a system configuration header, followed by columns for all counters.\nThis is ideal for remote debugging, use the \"--out\" option to save everything to a text file, and get that file to the expert helping you debug.\n.PP\nWhen you are not interested in all that information, and there are several ways to see only what you want.  First the \"--quiet\" option will skip the configuration information, and turbostat will show only the counter columns.  Second, you can reduce the columns with the \"--hide\" and \"--show\" options.  If you use the \"--show\" option, then turbostat will show only the columns you list.  If you use the \"--hide\" option, turbostat will show all columns, except the ones you list.\n.PP\nTo find out what columns are available for --show and --hide, the \"--list\" option is available.  Usually, the CATEGORY names above are used to refer to groups of counters.  Also, for convenience, the special string \"sysfs\" can be used to refer to all of the sysfs C-state counters at once:\n.PP\n.nf\nsudo ./turbostat --show sysfs --quiet sleep 10\n10.003837 sec\n\tC1\tC1E\tC3\tC6\tC7s\tC1%\tC1E%\tC3%\tC6%\tC7s%\n\t4\t21\t2\t2\t459\t0.14\t0.82\t0.00\t0.00\t98.93\n\t1\t17\t2\t2\t130\t0.00\t0.02\t0.00\t0.00\t99.80\n\t0\t0\t0\t0\t31\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t99.95\n\t2\t1\t0\t0\t52\t1.14\t6.49\t0.00\t0.00\t92.21\n\t1\t2\t0\t0\t52\t0.00\t0.08\t0.00\t0.00\t99.86\n\t0\t0\t0\t0\t71\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t99.89\n\t0\t0\t0\t0\t25\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t99.96\n\t0\t0\t0\t0\t74\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t99.94\n\t0\t1\t0\t0\t24\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t0.00\t99.84\n.fi\n.PP\n.SH ONE SHOT COMMAND EXAMPLE\nIf turbostat is invoked with a command, it will fork that command\nand output the statistics gathered after the command exits.\nIn this case, turbostat output goes to stderr, by default.\nOutput can instead be saved to a file using the --out option.\nIn this example, the \"sleep 10\" command is forked, and turbostat waits for it to complete before saving all statistics into \"ts.out\".  Note that \"sleep 10\" is not part of turbostat, but is simply an example of a command that turbostat can fork.  The \"ts.out\" file is what you want to edit in a very wide window, paste into a spreadsheet, or attach to a bugzilla entry.\n\n.nf\n[root@hsw]# ./turbostat -o ts.out sleep 10\n[root@hsw]#\n.fi\n\n.SH PERIODIC INTERVAL EXAMPLE\nWithout a command to fork, turbostat displays statistics ever 5 seconds.\nPeriodic output goes to stdout, by default, unless --out is used to specify an output file.\nThe 5-second interval can be changed with the \"-i sec\" option.\n.nf\nsudo turbostat --quiet --show CPU,frequency\n\tCore\tCPU\tAvg_MHz\tBusy%\tBzy_MHz\tTSC_MHz\tCPU%c7\tUncMhz\n\t-\t-\t524\t12.48\t4198\t3096\t74.53\t3800\n\t0\t0\t4\t0.09\t4081\t3096\t98.88\t3800\n\t0\t4\t1\t0.02\t4063\t3096\n\t1\t1\t2\t0.06\t4063\t3096\t99.60\n\t1\t5\t2\t0.05\t4070\t3096\n\t2\t2\t4178\t99.52\t4199\t3096\t0.00\n\t2\t6\t3\t0.08\t4159\t3096\n\t3\t3\t1\t0.04\t4046\t3096\t99.66\n\t3\t7\t0\t0.01\t3989\t3096\n\tCore\tCPU\tAvg_MHz\tBusy%\tBzy_MHz\tTSC_MHz\tCPU%c7\tUncMhz\n\t-\t-\t525\t12.52\t4198\t3096\t74.54\t3800\n\t0\t0\t4\t0.10\t4051\t3096\t99.49\t3800\n\t0\t4\t2\t0.04\t3993\t3096\n\t1\t1\t3\t0.07\t4054\t3096\t99.56\n\t1\t5\t4\t0.10\t4018\t3096\n\t2\t2\t4178\t99.51\t4199\t3096\t0.00\n\t2\t6\t4\t0.09\t4143\t3096\n\t3\t3\t2\t0.06\t4026\t3096\t99.10\n\t3\t7\t7\t0.17\t4074\t3096\n.fi\nThis example also shows the use of the --show option to show only the desired columns.\n\n.SH SYSTEM CONFIGURATION INFORMATION EXAMPLE\n\nBy default, turbostat always dumps system configuration information\nbefore taking measurements.

On a system where\nthe TSC stops in idle, TSC_MHz will drop\nbelow the processor's base frequency.\n\nBusy% = MPERF_delta/TSC_delta\n\nBzy_MHz = TSC_delta/APERF_delta/MPERF_delta/measurement_interval\n\nNote that these calculations depend on TSC_delta, so they\nare not reliable during intervals when TSC_MHz is not running at the base frequency.\n\nTurbostat data collection is not atomic.\nExtremely short measurement intervals (much less than 1 second),\nor system activity that prevents turbostat from being able\nto run on all CPUS to quickly collect data, will result in\ninconsistent results.\n\nThe APERF, MPERF MSRs are defined to count non-halted cycles.\nAlthough it is not guaranteed by the architecture, turbostat assumes\nthat they count at TSC rate, which is true on all processors tested to date.\n\n.SH REFERENCES\nVolume 3B: System Programming Guide\"\nhttps://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/\n\n.SH FILES\n.ta\n.nf\n/dev/cpu/*/msr\n.fi\n\n.SH \"SEE ALSO\"\nmsr(4), vmstat(8)\n.PP\n.SH AUTHOR\n.nf\nWritten by Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>\n",
