One example is disabling\nsleep states. This can be handy for power vs performance tuning.\n.SH \"OPTIONS\"\n.LP\n.TP\n\\fB\\-d\\fR \\fB\\-\\-disable\\fR <STATE_NO>\nDisable a specific processor sleep state.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-e\\fR \\fB\\-\\-enable\\fR <STATE_NO>\nEnable a specific processor sleep state.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-D\\fR \\fB\\-\\-disable-by-latency\\fR <LATENCY>\nDisable all idle states with a equal or higher latency than <LATENCY>.\n\nEnable all idle states with a latency lower than <LATENCY>.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-E\\fR \\fB\\-\\-enable-all\\fR\nEnable all idle states if not enabled already.\n\n.SH \"REMARKS\"\n.LP\nCpuidle Governors Policy on Disabling Sleep States\n\n.RS 4\nDepending on the used  cpuidle governor, implementing the kernel policy\nhow to choose sleep states, subsequent sleep states on this core, might get\ndisabled as well.\n\nThere are two cpuidle governors ladder and menu. While the ladder\ngovernor is always available, if CONFIG_CPU_IDLE is selected, the\nmenu governor additionally requires CONFIG_NO_HZ.\n\nThe behavior and the effect of the disable variable depends on the\nimplementation of a particular governor. In the ladder governor, for\nexample, it is not coherent, i.e. if one is disabling a light state,\nthen all deeper states are disabled as well. Likewise, if one enables a\ndeep state but a lighter state still is disabled, then this has no effect.\n.RE\n.LP\nDisabling the Lightest Sleep State may not have any Affect\n\n.RS 4\nIf criteria are not met to enter deeper sleep states and the lightest sleep\nstate is chosen when idle, the kernel may still enter this sleep state,\nirrespective of whether it is disabled or not. This is also reflected in\nthe usage count of the disabled sleep state when using the cpupower idle-info\ncommand.\n.RE\n.LP\nSelecting specific CPU Cores\n\n.RS 4\nBy default processor sleep states of all CPU cores are set. Please refer\nto the cpupower(1) manpage in the \\-\\-cpu option section how to disable\nC-states of specific cores.\n.RE\n.SH \"FILES\"\n.nf\n\\fI/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*\\fP\n\\fI/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/*\\fP\n.fi\n.SH \"AUTHORS\"\n.nf\nThomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de>\n.fi\n.SH \"SEE ALSO\"\n.LP\ncpupower(1), cpupower\\-monitor(1), cpupower\\-info(1), cpupower\\-set(1),\ncpupower\\-idle\\-info(1)\n",
