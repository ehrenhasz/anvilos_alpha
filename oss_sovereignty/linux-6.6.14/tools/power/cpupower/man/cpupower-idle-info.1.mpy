This\ninterface has been removed from the kernel for quite some time, do not let\nfurther code depend on this option, best do not use it.\n\n.SH IDLE\\-INFO DESCRIPTIONS\nCPU sleep state statistics and descriptions are retrieved from sysfs files,\nexported by the cpuidle kernel subsystem. The kernel only updates these\nstatistics when it enters or leaves an idle state, therefore on a very idle or\na very busy system, these statistics may not be accurate. They still provide a\ngood overview about the usage and availability of processor sleep states on\nthe platform.\n\nBe aware that the sleep states as exported by the hardware or BIOS and used by\nthe Linux kernel may not exactly reflect the capabilities of the\nprocessor. This often is the case on the X86 architecture when the acpi_idle\ndriver is used. It is also possible that the hardware overrules the kernel\nrequests, due to internal activity monitors or other reasons.\nOn recent X86 platforms it is often possible to read out hardware registers\nwhich monitor the duration of sleep states the processor resided in. The\ncpupower monitor tool (cpupower\\-monitor(1)) can be used to show real sleep\nstate residencies. Please refer to the architecture specific description\nsection below.\n\n.SH IDLE\\-INFO ARCHITECTURE SPECIFIC DESCRIPTIONS\n.SS \"X86\"\nPOLL idle state\n\nIf cpuidle is active, X86 platforms have one special idle state.\nThe POLL idle state is not a real idle state, it does not save any\npower. Instead, a busy\\-loop is executed doing nothing for a short period of\ntime. This state is used if the kernel knows that work has to be processed\nvery soon and entering any real hardware idle state may result in a slight\nperformance penalty.\n\nThere exist two different cpuidle drivers on the X86 architecture platform:\n\n\"acpi_idle\" cpuidle driver\n\nThe acpi_idle cpuidle driver retrieves available sleep states (C\\-states) from\nthe ACPI BIOS tables (from the _CST ACPI function on recent platforms or from\nthe FADT BIOS table on older ones).\nThe C1 state is not retrieved from ACPI tables. If the C1 state is entered,\nthe kernel will call the hlt instruction (or mwait on Intel).\n\n\"intel_idle\" cpuidle driver\n\nIn kernel 2.6.36 the intel_idle driver was introduced.\nIt only serves recent Intel CPUs (Nehalem, Westmere, Sandybridge, Atoms or\nnewer). On older Intel CPUs the acpi_idle driver is still used (if the BIOS\nprovides C\\-state ACPI tables).\nThe intel_idle driver knows the sleep state capabilities of the processor and\nignores ACPI BIOS exported processor sleep states tables.\n\n.SH \"REMARKS\"\n.LP\nBy default only values of core zero are displayed. How to display settings of\nother cores is described in the cpupower(1) manpage in the \\-\\-cpu option\nsection.\n.SH REFERENCES\nhttps://uefi.org/specifications\n.SH \"FILES\"\n.nf\n\\fI/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*\\fP\n\\fI/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/*\\fP\n.fi\n.SH \"AUTHORS\"\n.nf\nThomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de>\n.fi\n.SH \"SEE ALSO\"\n.LP\ncpupower(1), cpupower\\-monitor(1), cpupower\\-info(1), cpupower\\-set(1),\ncpupower\\-idle\\-set(1)\n",
