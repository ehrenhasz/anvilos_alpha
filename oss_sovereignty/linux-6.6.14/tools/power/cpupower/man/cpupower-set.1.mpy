By default values\nare applied on all cores. How to modify single core configurations is\ndescribed in the cpupower(1) manpage in the \\-\\-cpu option section. Whether an\noption affects the whole system or can be applied to individual cores is\ndescribed in the Options sections.\n\nUse \\fBcpupower info \\fP to read out current settings and whether they are\nsupported on the system at all.\n\n.SH Options\n.PP\n\\-\\-perf-bias, \\-b\n.RS 4\nSets a register on supported Intel processore which allows software to convey\nits policy for the relative importance of performance versus energy savings to\nthe  processor.\n\nThe range of valid numbers is 0-15, where 0 is maximum\nperformance and 15 is maximum energy efficiency.\n\nThe processor uses this information in model-specific ways\nwhen it must select trade-offs between performance and\nenergy efficiency.\n\nThis policy hint does not supersede Processor Performance states\n(P-states) or CPU Idle power states (C-states), but allows\nsoftware to have influence where it would otherwise be unable\nto express a preference.\n\nFor example, this setting may tell the hardware how\naggressively or conservatively to control frequency\nin the \"turbo range\" above the explicitly OS-controlled\nP-state frequency range.  It may also tell the hardware\nhow aggressively it should enter the OS requested C-states.\n\nThis option can be applied to individual cores only via the \\-\\-cpu option,\ncpupower(1).\n\nSetting the performance bias value on one CPU can modify the setting on\nrelated CPUs as well (for example all CPUs on one socket), because of\nhardware restrictions.\nUse \\fBcpupower -c all info -b\\fP to verify.\n\nThis options needs the msr kernel driver (CONFIG_X86_MSR) loaded.\n.RE\n\n.SH \"SEE ALSO\"\ncpupower-info(1), cpupower-monitor(1), powertop(1)\n.PP\n.SH AUTHORS\n.nf\n\\-\\-perf\\-bias parts written by Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>\nThomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de>\n",
