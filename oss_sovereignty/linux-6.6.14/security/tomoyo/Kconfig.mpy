This option will be useful for systems where\n\t  operations which can lead to the hijacking of the boot sequence are\n\t  needed before loading the policy. For example, you can activate\n\t  immediately after loading the fixed part of policy which will allow\n\t  only operations needed for mounting a partition which contains the\n\t  variant part of policy and verifying (e.g. running GPG check) and\n\t  loading the variant part of policy. Since you can start using\n\t  enforcing mode from the beginning, you can reduce the possibility of\n\t  hijacking the boot sequence.\n\nconfig SECURITY_TOMOYO_POLICY_LOADER\n\tstring \"Location of userspace policy loader\"\n\tdefault \"/sbin/tomoyo-init\"\n\tdepends on SECURITY_TOMOYO\n\tdepends on !SECURITY_TOMOYO_OMIT_USERSPACE_LOADER\n\thelp\n\t  This is the default pathname of policy loader which is called before\n\t  activation.
