The\n\t  intention is that a process can be granted a wide set\n\t  of access initially with the bringup mode set on the\n\t  rules. The developer can use the information to\n\t  identify which rules are necessary and what accesses\n\t  may be inappropriate. The developer can reduce the\n\t  access rule set once the behavior is well understood.\n\t  This is a superior mechanism to the oft abused\n\t  \"permissive\" mode of other systems.\n\t  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.\n\nconfig SECURITY_SMACK_NETFILTER\n\tbool \"Packet marking using secmarks for netfilter\"\n\tdepends on SECURITY_SMACK\n\tdepends on NETWORK_SECMARK\n\tdepends on NETFILTER\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  This enables security marking of network packets using\n\t  Smack labels.\n\t  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.\n\nconfig SECURITY_SMACK_APPEND_SIGNALS\n\tbool \"Treat delivering signals as an append operation\"\n\tdepends on SECURITY_SMACK\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  Sending a signal has been treated as a write operation to the\n\t  receiving process.
