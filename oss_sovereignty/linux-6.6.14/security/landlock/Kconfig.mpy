A Landlock security policy is a\n\t  set of access rights (e.g. open a file in read-only, make a\n\t  directory, etc.) tied to a file hierarchy.  Such policy can be\n\t  configured and enforced by any processes for themselves using the\n\t  dedicated system calls: landlock_create_ruleset(),\n\t  landlock_add_rule(), and landlock_restrict_self().\n\n\t  See Documentation/userspace-api/landlock.rst for further information.\n\n\t  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.  Otherwise,\n\t  you should also prepend \"landlock,\" to the content of CONFIG_LSM to\n\t  enable Landlock at boot time.\n",
