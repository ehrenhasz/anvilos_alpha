The ext4 filesystem also supports delayed\n\t  allocation, persistent preallocation, high resolution time stamps,\n\t  and a number of other features to improve performance and speed\n\t  up fsck time.  For more information, please see the web pages at\n\t  http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org.\n\n\t  The ext4 filesystem supports mounting an ext3 filesystem; while there\n\t  are some performance gains from the delayed allocation and inode\n\t  table readahead, the best performance gains require enabling ext4\n\t  features in the filesystem using tune2fs, or formatting a new\n\t  filesystem as an ext4 filesystem initially. Without explicit enabling\n\t  of ext4 features, the on disk filesystem format stays fully backward\n\t  compatible.\n\n\t  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here.
