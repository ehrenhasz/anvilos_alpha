Coda has several advantages over NFS: support for\n\t  disconnected operation (e.g. for laptops), read/write server\n\t  replication, security model for authentication and encryption,\n\t  persistent client caches and write back caching.\n\n\t  If you say Y here, your Linux box will be able to act as a Coda\n\t  *client*.  You will need user level code as well, both for the\n\t  client and server.  Servers are currently user level, i.e. they need\n\t  no kernel support.  Please read\n\t  <file:Documentation/filesystems/coda.rst> and check out the Coda\n\t  home page <http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/>.\n\n\t  To compile the coda client support as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coda.\n",
