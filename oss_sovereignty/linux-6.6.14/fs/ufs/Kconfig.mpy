Some System V\n\t  Unixes can create and mount hard disk partitions and diskettes using\n\t  this file system as well. Saying Y here will allow you to read from\n\t  these partitions; if you also want to write to them, say Y to the\n\t  experimental \"UFS file system write support\", below. Please read the\n\t  file <file:Documentation/admin-guide/ufs.rst> for more information.\n\n          The recently released UFS2 variant (used in FreeBSD 5.x) is\n          READ-ONLY supported.\n\n\t  Note that this option is generally not needed for floppies, since a\n\t  good portable way to transport files and directories between unixes\n\t  (and even other operating systems) is given by the tar program (\"man\n\t  tar\" or preferably \"info tar\").\n\n\t  When accessing NeXTstep files, you may need to convert them from the\n\t  NeXT character set to the Latin1 character set; use the program\n\t  recode (\"info recode\") for this purpose.\n\n\t  To compile the UFS file system support as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called ufs.\n\n\t  If you haven't heard about all of this before, it's safe to say N.\n\nconfig UFS_FS_WRITE\n\tbool \"UFS file system write support (DANGEROUS)\"\n\tdepends on UFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to try writing to UFS partitions. This is\n\t  experimental, so you should back up your UFS partitions beforehand.\n\nconfig UFS_DEBUG\n\tbool \"UFS debugging\"\n\tdepends on UFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  If you are experiencing any problems with the UFS filesystem, say\n\t  Y here.  This will result in _many_ additional debugging messages to be\n\t  written to the system log.\n",
