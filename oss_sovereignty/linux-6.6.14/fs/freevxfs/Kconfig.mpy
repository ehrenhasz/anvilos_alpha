VERITAS VxFS(TM) is the standard file system\n\t  of SCO UnixWare (and possibly others) and optionally available\n\t  for Sunsoft Solaris, HP-UX and many other operating systems. However\n\t  these particular OS implementations of vxfs may differ in on-disk\n\t  data endianness and/or superblock offset. The vxfs module has been\n\t  tested with SCO UnixWare and HP-UX B.10.20 (pa-risc 1.1 arch.)\n\t  Currently only readonly access is supported and VxFX versions\n\t  2, 3 and 4. Tests were performed with HP-UX VxFS version 3.\n\n\t  NOTE: the file system type as used by mount(1), mount(2) and\n\t  fstab(5) is 'vxfs' as it describes the file system format, not\n\t  the actual driver.\n\n\t  There is a userspace utility for HP-UX logical volumes which makes\n\t  creating HP-UX logical volumes easy from HP-UX disk block device file\n\t  or regular file with image of the disk. See:\n\t         https://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-vxfs/\n\n\t  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called freevxfs.  If unsure, say N.\n",
