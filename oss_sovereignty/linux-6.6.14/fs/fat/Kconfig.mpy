You will then be able to mount partitions or\n\t  diskettes with FAT-based file systems and transparently access the\n\t  files on them, i.e. MSDOS files will look and behave just like all\n\t  other Unix files.\n\n\t  This FAT support is not a file system in itself, it only provides\n\t  the foundation for the other file systems. You will have to say Y or\n\t  M to at least one of \"MSDOS fs support\" or \"VFAT fs support\" in\n\t  order to make use of it.\n\n\t  Another way to read and write MSDOS floppies and hard drive\n\t  partitions from within Linux (but not transparently) is with the\n\t  mtools (\"man mtools\") program suite. You don't need to say Y here in\n\t  order to do that.\n\n\t  If you need to move large files on floppies between a DOS and a\n\t  Linux box, say Y here, mount the floppy under Linux with an MSDOS\n\t  file system and use GNU tar's M option. GNU tar is a program\n\t  available for Unix and DOS (\"man tar\" or \"info tar\").\n\n\t  The FAT support will enlarge your kernel by about 37 KB. If unsure,\n\t  say Y.\n\n\t  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called\n\t  fat.  Note that if you compile the FAT support as a module, you\n\t  cannot compile any of the FAT-based file systems into the kernel\n\t  -- they will have to be modules as well.\n\nconfig MSDOS_FS\n\ttristate \"MSDOS fs support\"\n\tselect FAT_FS\n\thelp\n\t  This allows you to mount MSDOS partitions of your hard drive (unless\n\t  they are compressed; to access compressed MSDOS partitions under\n\t  Linux, you can either use the DOS emulator DOSEMU, described in the\n\t  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <https://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, or try dmsdosfs in\n\t  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/>. If you\n\t  intend to use dosemu with a non-compressed MSDOS partition, say Y\n\t  here) and MSDOS floppies. This means that file access becomes\n\t  transparent, i.e. the MSDOS files look and behave just like all\n\t  other Unix files.\n\n\t  If you have Windows 95 or Windows NT installed on your MSDOS\n\t  partitions, you should use the VFAT file system (say Y to \"VFAT fs\n\t  support\" below), or you will not be able to see the long filenames\n\t  generated by Windows 95 / Windows NT.\n\n\t  This option will enlarge your kernel by about 7 KB. If unsure,\n\t  answer Y. This will only work if you said Y to \"DOS FAT fs support\"\n\t  as well. To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will\n\t  be called msdos.\n\nconfig VFAT_FS\n\ttristate \"VFAT (Windows-95) fs support\"\n\tselect FAT_FS\n\thelp\n\t  This option provides support for normal Windows file systems with\n\t  long filenames.  That includes non-compressed FAT-based file systems\n\t  used by Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and the Unix\n\t  programs from the mtools package.\n\n\t  The VFAT support enlarges your kernel by about 10 KB and it only\n\t  works if you said Y to the \"DOS FAT fs support\" above.  Please read\n\t  the file <file:Documentation/filesystems/vfat.rst> for details.  If\n\t  unsure, say Y.\n\n\t  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called\n\t  vfat.\n\nconfig FAT_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE\n\tint \"Default codepage for FAT\"\n\tdepends on FAT_FS\n\tdefault 437\n\thelp\n\t  This option should be set to the codepage of your FAT filesystems.\n\t  It can be overridden with the \"codepage\" mount option.\n\t  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/vfat.rst> for more information.\n\nconfig FAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET\n\tstring \"Default iocharset for FAT\"\n\tdepends on VFAT_FS\n\tdefault \"iso8859-1\"\n\thelp\n\t  Set this to the default input/output character set you'd\n\t  like FAT to use. It should probably match the character set\n\t  that most of your FAT filesystems use, and can be overridden\n\t  with the \"iocharset\" mount option for FAT filesystems.\n\t  Note that \"utf8\" is not recommended for FAT filesystems.\n\t  If unsure, you shouldn't set \"utf8\" here - select the next option\n\t  instead if you would like to use UTF-8 encoded file names by default.\n\t  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/vfat.rst> for more information.\n\n\t  Enable any character sets you need in File Systems/Native Language\n\t  Support.\n\nconfig FAT_DEFAULT_UTF8\n\tbool \"Enable FAT UTF-8 option by default\"\n\tdepends on VFAT_FS\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  Set this if you would like to have \"utf8\" mount option set\n\t  by default when mounting FAT filesystems.\n\n\t  Even if you say Y here can always disable UTF-8 for\n\t  particular mount by adding \"utf8=0\" to mount options.\n\n\t  Say Y if you use UTF-8 encoding for file names, N otherwise.\n\n\t  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/vfat.rst> for more information.\n\nconfig FAT_KUNIT_TEST\n\ttristate \"Unit Tests for FAT filesystems\" if !KUNIT_ALL_TESTS\n\tdepends on KUNIT && FAT_FS\n\tdefault KUNIT_ALL_TESTS\n\thelp\n\t  This builds the FAT KUnit tests\n\n\t  For more information on KUnit and unit tests in general, please refer\n\t  to the KUnit documentation in Documentation/dev-tools/kunit\n\n\t  If unsure, say N\n",
