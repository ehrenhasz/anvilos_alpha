CIFS was the successor to the original network filesystem\n\t  protocol, Server Message Block (SMB ie SMB1), the native file sharing\n\t  mechanism for most early PC operating systems.\n\n\t  The SMB3.1.1 protocol is supported by most modern operating systems\n\t  and NAS appliances (e.g. Samba, Windows 11, Windows Server 2022,\n\t  MacOS) and even in the cloud (e.g. Microsoft Azure) and also by the\n\t  Linux kernel server, ksmbd.  Support for the older CIFS protocol was\n\t  included in Windows NT4, 2000 and XP (and later). Use of dialects\n\t  older than SMB2.1 is often discouraged on public networks.\n\t  This module also provides limited support for OS/2 and Windows ME\n\t  and similar very old servers.\n\n\t  This module provides an advanced network file system client for\n\t  mounting to SMB3 (and CIFS) compliant servers.  It includes support\n\t  for DFS (hierarchical name space), secure per-user session\n\t  establishment via Kerberos or NTLMv2, RDMA (smbdirect), advanced\n\t  security features, per-share encryption, packet-signing, snapshots,\n\t  directory leases, safe distributed caching (leases), multichannel,\n\t  Unicode and other internationalization improvements.\n\n\t  In general, the default dialects, SMB3 and later, enable better\n\t  performance, security and features, than would be possible with CIFS.\n\n\t  If you need to mount to Samba, Azure, ksmbd, Macs or Windows from this\n\t  machine, say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_STATS2\n\tbool \"Extended statistics\"\n\tdepends on CIFS\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Enabling this option will allow more detailed statistics on SMB\n\t  request timing to be displayed in /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData and also\n\t  allow optional logging of slow responses to dmesg (depending on the\n\t  value of /proc/fs/cifs/cifsFYI). See Documentation/admin-guide/cifs/usage.rst\n\t  for more details. These additional statistics may have a minor effect\n\t  on performance and memory utilization.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_ALLOW_INSECURE_LEGACY\n\tbool \"Support legacy servers which use less secure dialects\"\n\tdepends on CIFS\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Modern dialects, SMB2.1 and later (including SMB3 and 3.1.1), have\n\t  additional security features, including protection against\n\t  man-in-the-middle attacks and stronger crypto hashes, so the use\n\t  of legacy dialects (SMB1/CIFS and SMB2.0) is discouraged.\n\n\t  Disabling this option prevents users from using vers=1.0 or vers=2.0\n\t  on mounts with cifs.ko\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_UPCALL\n\tbool \"Kerberos/SPNEGO advanced session setup\"\n\tdepends on CIFS\n\thelp\n\t  Enables an upcall mechanism for CIFS which accesses userspace helper\n\t  utilities to provide SPNEGO packaged (RFC 4178) Kerberos tickets\n\t  which are needed to mount to certain secure servers (for which more\n\t  secure Kerberos authentication is required). If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_XATTR\n\tbool \"CIFS extended attributes\"\n\tdepends on CIFS\n\thelp\n\t  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by\n\t  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page for details).\n\t  CIFS maps the name of extended attributes beginning with the user\n\t  namespace prefix to SMB/CIFS EAs.  EAs are stored on Windows\n\t  servers without the user namespace prefix, but their names are\n\t  seen by Linux cifs clients prefaced by the user namespace prefix.\n\t  The system namespace (used by some filesystems to store ACLs) is\n\t  not supported at this time.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_POSIX\n\tbool \"CIFS POSIX Extensions\"\n\tdepends on CIFS && CIFS_ALLOW_INSECURE_LEGACY && CIFS_XATTR\n\thelp\n\t  Enabling this option will cause the cifs client to attempt to\n\t  negotiate a feature of the older cifs dialect with servers, such as\n\t  Samba 3.0.5 or later, that optionally can handle more POSIX like\n\t  (rather than Windows like) file behavior.  It also enables support\n\t  for POSIX ACLs (getfacl and setfacl) to servers (such as Samba 3.10\n\t  and later) which can negotiate CIFS POSIX ACL support.  This config\n\t  option is not needed when mounting with SMB3.1.1. If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig CIFS_DEBUG\n\tbool \"Enable CIFS debugging routines\"\n\tdefault y\n\tdepends on CIFS\n\thelp\n\t  Enabling this option adds helpful debugging messages to\n\t  the cifs code which increases the size of the cifs module.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_DEBUG2\n\tbool \"Enable additional CIFS debugging routines\"\n\tdepends on CIFS_DEBUG\n\thelp\n\t  Enabling this option adds a few more debugging routines\n\t  to the cifs code which slightly increases the size of\n\t  the cifs module and can cause additional logging of debug\n\t  messages in some error paths, slowing performance. This\n\t  option can be turned off unless you are debugging\n\t  cifs problems.  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig CIFS_DEBUG_DUMP_KEYS\n\tbool \"Dump encryption keys for offline decryption (Unsafe)\"\n\tdepends on CIFS_DEBUG\n\thelp\n\t  Enabling this will dump the encryption and decryption keys\n\t  used to communicate on an encrypted share connection on the\n\t  console. This allows Wireshark to decrypt and dissect\n\t  encrypted network captures. Enable this carefully.\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig CIFS_DFS_UPCALL\n\tbool \"DFS feature support\"\n\tdepends on CIFS\n\thelp\n\t  Distributed File System (DFS) support is used to access shares\n\t  transparently in an enterprise name space, even if the share\n\t  moves to a different server.  This feature also enables\n\t  an upcall mechanism for CIFS which contacts userspace helper\n\t  utilities to provide server name resolution (host names to\n\t  IP addresses) which is needed in order to reconnect to\n\t  servers if their addresses change or for implicit mounts of\n\t  DFS junction points. If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_SWN_UPCALL\n\tbool \"SWN feature support\"\n\tdepends on CIFS\n\thelp\n\t  The Service Witness Protocol (SWN) is used to get notifications\n\t  from a highly available server of resource state changes. This\n\t  feature enables an upcall mechanism for CIFS which contacts a\n\t  userspace daemon to establish the DCE/RPC connection to retrieve\n\t  the cluster available interfaces and resource change notifications.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_NFSD_EXPORT\n\tbool \"Allow nfsd to export CIFS file system\"\n\tdepends on CIFS && BROKEN\n\thelp\n\t  Allows NFS server to export a CIFS mounted share (nfsd over cifs)\n\nif CIFS\n\nconfig CIFS_SMB_DIRECT\n\tbool \"SMB Direct support\"\n\tdepends on CIFS=m && INFINIBAND && INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS || CIFS=y && INFINIBAND=y && INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS=y\n\thelp\n\t  Enables SMB Direct support for SMB 3.0, 3.02 and 3.1.1.\n\t  SMB Direct allows transferring SMB packets over RDMA. If unsure,\n\t  say Y.\n\nconfig CIFS_FSCACHE\n\tbool \"Provide CIFS client caching support\"\n\tdepends on CIFS=m && FSCACHE || CIFS=y && FSCACHE=y\n\thelp\n\t  Makes CIFS FS-Cache capable. Say Y here if you want your CIFS data\n\t  to be cached locally on disk through the general filesystem cache\n\t  manager. If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig CIFS_ROOT\n\tbool \"SMB root file system (Experimental)\"\n\tdepends on CIFS=y && IP_PNP\n\thelp\n\t  Enables root file system support over SMB protocol.\n\n\t  Most people say N here.\n\nendif\n",
