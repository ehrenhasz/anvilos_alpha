It is usually mounted under /stand\n\t  and corresponds to the slice marked as \"STAND\" in the UnixWare\n\t  partition.  You should say Y if you want to read or write the files\n\t  on your /stand slice from within Linux.  You then also need to say Y\n\t  to \"UnixWare slices support\", below.  More information about the BFS\n\t  file system is contained in the file\n\t  <file:Documentation/filesystems/bfs.rst>.\n\n\t  If you don't know what this is about, say N.\n\n\t  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called\n\t  bfs.
