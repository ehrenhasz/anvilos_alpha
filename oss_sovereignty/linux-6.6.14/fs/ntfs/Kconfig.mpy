There is partial, but\n\t  safe, write support available.  For write support you must also\n\t  say Y to \"NTFS write support\" below.\n\n\t  There are also a number of user-space tools available, called\n\t  ntfsprogs.  These include ntfsundelete and ntfsresize, that work\n\t  without NTFS support enabled in the kernel.\n\n\t  This is a rewrite from scratch of Linux NTFS support and replaced\n\t  the old NTFS code starting with Linux 2.5.11.  A backport to\n\t  the Linux 2.4 kernel series is separately available as a patch\n\t  from the project web site.\n\n\t  For more information see <file:Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.rst>\n\t  and <http://www.linux-ntfs.org/>.\n\n\t  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called ntfs.\n\n\t  If you are not using Windows NT, 2000, XP or 2003 in addition to\n\t  Linux on your computer it is safe to say N.\n\nconfig NTFS_DEBUG\n\tbool \"NTFS debugging support\"\n\tdepends on NTFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  If you are experiencing any problems with the NTFS file system, say\n\t  Y here.  This will result in additional consistency checks to be\n\t  performed by the driver as well as additional debugging messages to\n\t  be written to the system log.  Note that debugging messages are\n\t  disabled by default.  To enable them, supply the option debug_msgs=1\n\t  at the kernel command line when booting the kernel or as an option\n\t  to insmod when loading the ntfs module.  Once the driver is active,\n\t  you can enable debugging messages by doing (as root):\n\t  echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug\n\t  Replacing the \"1\" with \"0\" would disable debug messages.\n\n\t  If you leave debugging messages disabled, this results in little\n\t  overhead, but enabling debug messages results in very significant\n\t  slowdown of the system.\n\n\t  When reporting bugs, please try to have available a full dump of\n\t  debugging messages while the misbehaviour was occurring.\n\nconfig NTFS_RW\n\tbool \"NTFS write support\"\n\tdepends on NTFS_FS\n\tdepends on PAGE_SIZE_LESS_THAN_64KB\n\thelp\n\t  This enables the partial, but safe, write support in the NTFS driver.\n\n\t  The only supported operation is overwriting existing files, without\n\t  changing the file length.  No file or directory creation, deletion or\n\t  renaming is possible.  Note only non-resident files can be written to\n\t  so you may find that some very small files (<500 bytes or so) cannot\n\t  be written to.\n\n\t  While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have\n\t  so far not received a single report where the driver would have\n\t  damaged someones data so we assume it is perfectly safe to use.\n\n\t  Note:  While write support is safe in this version (a rewrite from\n\t  scratch of the NTFS support), it should be noted that the old NTFS\n\t  write support, included in Linux 2.5.10 and before (since 1997),\n\t  is not safe.\n\n\t  This is currently useful with TopologiLinux.  TopologiLinux is run\n\t  on top of any DOS/Microsoft Windows system without partitioning your\n\t  hard disk.  Unlike other Linux distributions TopologiLinux does not\n\t  need its own partition.  For more information see\n\t  <http://topologi-linux.sourceforge.net/>\n\n\t  It is perfectly safe to say N here.\n",
