Currently, it works for the\n\t  ext2, ext3, ext4, f2fs, jfs, ocfs2 and reiserfs file systems.\n\t  Note that gfs2 and xfs use their own quota system.\n\t  Ext3, ext4 and reiserfs also support journaled quotas for which\n\t  you don't need to run quotacheck(8) after an unclean shutdown.\n\t  For further details, read the Quota mini-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <https://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, or the documentation provided\n\t  with the quota tools. Probably the quota support is only useful for\n\t  multi user systems.
