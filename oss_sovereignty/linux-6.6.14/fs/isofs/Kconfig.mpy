The so-called Rock-Ridge extensions which allow for\n\t  long Unix filenames and symbolic links are also supported by this\n\t  driver.  If you have a CD-ROM drive and want to do more with it than\n\t  just listen to audio CDs and watch its LEDs, say Y (and read\n\t  <file:Documentation/filesystems/isofs.rst> and the CD-ROM-HOWTO,\n\t  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), thereby\n\t  enlarging your kernel by about 27 KB; otherwise say N.\n\n\t  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called isofs.\n\nconfig JOLIET\n\tbool \"Microsoft Joliet CDROM extensions\"\n\tdepends on ISO9660_FS\n\tselect NLS\n\thelp\n\t  Joliet is a Microsoft extension for the ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system\n\t  which allows for long filenames in unicode format (unicode is the\n\t  new 16 bit character code, successor to ASCII, which encodes the\n\t  characters of almost all languages of the world; see\n\t  <http://www.unicode.org/> for more information).  Say Y here if you\n\t  want to be able to read Joliet CD-ROMs under Linux.\n\nconfig ZISOFS\n\tbool \"Transparent decompression extension\"\n\tdepends on ISO9660_FS\n\tselect ZLIB_INFLATE\n\thelp\n\t  This is a Linux-specific extension to RockRidge which lets you store\n\t  data in compressed form on a CD-ROM and have it transparently\n\t  decompressed when the CD-ROM is accessed.  See\n\t  <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/fs/zisofs/> for the tools\n\t  necessary to create such a filesystem.  Say Y here if you want to be\n\t  able to read such compressed CD-ROMs.\n",
