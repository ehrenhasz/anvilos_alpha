On supported\n\t  filesystems (currently ext4, f2fs, and btrfs), userspace can\n\t  use an ioctl to enable verity for a file, which causes the\n\t  filesystem to build a Merkle tree for the file.  The filesystem\n\t  will then transparently verify any data read from the file\n\t  against the Merkle tree.  The file is also made read-only.\n\n\t  This serves as an integrity check, but the availability of the\n\t  Merkle tree root hash also allows efficiently supporting\n\t  various use cases where normally the whole file would need to\n\t  be hashed at once, such as: (a) auditing (logging the file's\n\t  hash), or (b) authenticity verification (comparing the hash\n\t  against a known good value, e.g. from a digital signature).\n\n\t  fs-verity is especially useful on large files where not all\n\t  the contents may actually be needed.  Also, fs-verity verifies\n\t  data each time it is paged back in, which provides better\n\t  protection against malicious disks vs. an ahead-of-time hash.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig FS_VERITY_BUILTIN_SIGNATURES\n\tbool \"FS Verity builtin signature support\"\n\tdepends on FS_VERITY\n\tselect SYSTEM_DATA_VERIFICATION\n\thelp\n\t  This option adds support for in-kernel verification of\n\t  fs-verity builtin signatures.\n\n\t  Please take great care before using this feature.  It is not\n\t  the only way to do signatures with fs-verity, and the\n\t  alternatives (such as userspace signature verification, and\n\t  IMA appraisal) can be much better.  For details about the\n\t  limitations of this feature, see\n\t  Documentation/filesystems/fsverity.rst.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n",
