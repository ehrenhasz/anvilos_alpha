If there\n\t  is a format change, file systems with a unchanged format will\n\t  continue to be mountable and usable by newer kernels.\n\n\t  For more information, please see the web pages at\n\t  https://btrfs.readthedocs.io\n\n\t  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here. The\n\t  module will be called btrfs.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig BTRFS_FS_POSIX_ACL\n\tbool \"Btrfs POSIX Access Control Lists\"\n\tdepends on BTRFS_FS\n\tselect FS_POSIX_ACL\n\thelp\n\t  POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and\n\t  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.\n\n\t  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N\n\nconfig BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY\n\tbool \"Btrfs with integrity check tool compiled in (DEPRECATED)\"\n\tdepends on BTRFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  This feature has been deprecated and will be removed in 6.7.\n\n\t  Adds code that examines all block write requests (including\n\t  writes of the super block). The goal is to verify that the\n\t  state of the filesystem on disk is always consistent, i.e.,\n\t  after a power-loss or kernel panic event the filesystem is\n\t  in a consistent state.\n\n\t  If the integrity check tool is included and activated in\n\t  the mount options, plenty of kernel memory is used, and\n\t  plenty of additional CPU cycles are spent. Enabling this\n\t  functionality is not intended for normal use.\n\n\t  In most cases, unless you are a btrfs developer who needs\n\t  to verify the integrity of (super)-block write requests\n\t  during the run of a regression test, say N\n\nconfig BTRFS_FS_RUN_SANITY_TESTS\n\tbool \"Btrfs will run sanity tests upon loading\"\n\tdepends on BTRFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  This will run some basic sanity tests on the free space cache\n\t  code to make sure it is acting as it should.  These are mostly\n\t  regression tests and are only really interesting to btrfs\n\t  developers.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig BTRFS_DEBUG\n\tbool \"Btrfs debugging support\"\n\tdepends on BTRFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  Enable run-time debugging support for the btrfs filesystem.
