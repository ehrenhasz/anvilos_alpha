It is completely multi-threaded, can\n\t  support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,\n\t  variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of\n\t  Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance\n\t  and scalability.\n\n\t  Refer to the documentation at <http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/>\n\t  for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible\n\t  with the IRIX version of XFS.\n\n\t  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called xfs.  Be aware, however, that if the file\n\t  system of your root partition is compiled as a module, you'll need\n\t  to use an initial ramdisk (initrd) to boot.\n\nconfig XFS_SUPPORT_V4\n\tbool \"Support deprecated V4 (crc=0) format\"\n\tdepends on XFS_FS\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  The V4 filesystem format lacks certain features that are supported\n\t  by the V5 format, such as metadata checksumming, strengthened\n\t  metadata verification, and the ability to store timestamps past the\n\t  year 2038.  Because of this, the V4 format is deprecated.  All users\n\t  should upgrade by backing up their files, reformatting, and restoring\n\t  from the backup.\n\n\t  Administrators and users can detect a V4 filesystem by running\n\t  xfs_info against a filesystem mountpoint and checking for a string\n\t  beginning with \"crc=\".  If the string \"crc=0\" is found, the\n\t  filesystem is a V4 filesystem.  If no such string is found, please\n\t  upgrade xfsprogs to the latest version and try again.\n\n\t  This option will become default N in September 2025.  Support for the\n\t  V4 format will be removed entirely in September 2030.  Distributors\n\t  can say N here to withdraw support earlier.\n\n\t  To continue supporting the old V4 format (crc=0), say Y.\n\t  To close off an attack surface, say N.\n\nconfig XFS_SUPPORT_ASCII_CI\n\tbool \"Support deprecated case-insensitive ascii (ascii-ci=1) format\"\n\tdepends on XFS_FS\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  The ASCII case insensitivity filesystem feature only works correctly\n\t  on systems that have been coerced into using ISO 8859-1, and it does\n\t  not work on extended attributes.  The kernel has no visibility into\n\t  the locale settings in userspace, so it corrupts UTF-8 names.\n\t  Enabling this feature makes XFS vulnerable to mixed case sensitivity\n\t  attacks.  Because of this, the feature is deprecated.  All users\n\t  should upgrade by backing up their files, reformatting, and restoring\n\t  from the backup.\n\n\t  Administrators and users can detect such a filesystem by running\n\t  xfs_info against a filesystem mountpoint and checking for a string\n\t  beginning with \"ascii-ci=\".  If the string \"ascii-ci=1\" is found, the\n\t  filesystem is a case-insensitive filesystem.  If no such string is\n\t  found, please upgrade xfsprogs to the latest version and try again.\n\n\t  This option will become default N in September 2025.  Support for the\n\t  feature will be removed entirely in September 2030.  Distributors\n\t  can say N here to withdraw support earlier.\n\n\t  To continue supporting case-insensitivity (ascii-ci=1), say Y.\n\t  To close off an attack surface, say N.\n\nconfig XFS_QUOTA\n\tbool \"XFS Quota support\"\n\tdepends on XFS_FS\n\tselect QUOTACTL\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, you will be able to set limits for disk usage on\n\t  a per user and/or a per group basis under XFS.  XFS considers quota\n\t  information as filesystem metadata and uses journaling to provide a\n\t  higher level guarantee of consistency.  The on-disk data format for\n\t  quota is also compatible with the IRIX version of XFS, allowing a\n\t  filesystem to be migrated between Linux and IRIX without any need\n\t  for conversion.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.  More comprehensive documentation can be found in\n\t  README.quota in the xfsprogs package.  XFS quota can be used either\n\t  with or without the generic quota support enabled (CONFIG_QUOTA) -\n\t  they are completely independent subsystems.\n\nconfig XFS_POSIX_ACL\n\tbool \"XFS POSIX ACL support\"\n\tdepends on XFS_FS\n\tselect FS_POSIX_ACL\n\thelp\n\t  POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and\n\t  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.\n\n\t  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N.\n\nconfig XFS_RT\n\tbool \"XFS Realtime subvolume support\"\n\tdepends on XFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here you will be able to mount and use XFS filesystems\n\t  which contain a realtime subvolume.  The realtime subvolume is a\n\t  separate area of disk space where only file data is stored.  It was\n\t  originally designed to provide deterministic data rates suitable\n\t  for media streaming applications, but is also useful as a generic\n\t  mechanism for ensuring data and metadata/log I/Os are completely\n\t  separated.  Regular file I/Os are isolated to a separate device\n\t  from all other requests, and this can be done quite transparently\n\t  to applications via the inherit-realtime directory inode flag.\n\n\t  See the xfs man page in section 5 for additional information.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig XFS_DRAIN_INTENTS\n\tbool\n\tselect JUMP_LABEL if HAVE_ARCH_JUMP_LABEL\n\nconfig XFS_ONLINE_SCRUB\n\tbool \"XFS online metadata check support\"\n\tdefault n\n\tdepends on XFS_FS\n\tdepends on TMPFS && SHMEM\n\tselect XFS_DRAIN_INTENTS\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here you will be able to check metadata on a\n\t  mounted XFS filesystem.  This feature is intended to reduce\n\t  filesystem downtime by supplementing xfs_repair.  The key\n\t  advantage here is to look for problems proactively so that\n\t  they can be dealt with in a controlled manner.\n\n\t  This feature is considered EXPERIMENTAL.  Use with caution!\n\n\t  See the xfs_scrub man page in section 8 for additional information.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig XFS_ONLINE_SCRUB_STATS\n\tbool \"XFS online metadata check usage data collection\"\n\tdefault y\n\tdepends on XFS_ONLINE_SCRUB\n\tselect XFS_DEBUG\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, the kernel will gather usage data about\n\t  the online metadata check subsystem.  This includes the number\n\t  of invocations, the outcomes, and the results of repairs, if any.\n\t  This may slow down scrub slightly due to the use of high precision\n\t  timers and the need to merge per-invocation information into the\n\t  filesystem counters.\n\n\t  Usage data are collected in /sys/kernel/debug/xfs/scrub.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig XFS_ONLINE_REPAIR\n\tbool \"XFS online metadata repair support\"\n\tdefault n\n\tdepends on XFS_FS && XFS_ONLINE_SCRUB\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here you will be able to repair metadata on a\n\t  mounted XFS filesystem.  This feature is intended to reduce\n\t  filesystem downtime by fixing minor problems before they cause the\n\t  filesystem to go down.  However, it requires that the filesystem be\n\t  formatted with secondary metadata, such as reverse mappings and inode\n\t  parent pointers.\n\n\t  This feature is considered EXPERIMENTAL.  Use with caution!\n\n\t  See the xfs_scrub man page in section 8 for additional information.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig XFS_WARN\n\tbool \"XFS Verbose Warnings\"\n\tdepends on XFS_FS && !XFS_DEBUG\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to get an XFS build with many additional warnings.\n\t  It converts ASSERT checks to WARN, so will log any out-of-bounds\n\t  conditions that occur that would otherwise be missed. It is much\n\t  lighter weight than XFS_DEBUG and does not modify algorithms and will\n\t  not cause the kernel to panic on non-fatal errors.\n\n\t  However, similar to XFS_DEBUG, it is only advisable to use this if you\n\t  are debugging a particular problem.\n\nconfig XFS_DEBUG\n\tbool \"XFS Debugging support\"\n\tdepends on XFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to get an XFS build with many debugging features,\n\t  including ASSERT checks, function wrappers around macros,\n\t  and extra sanity-checking functions in various code paths.\n\n\t  Note that the resulting code will be HUGE and SLOW, and probably\n\t  not useful unless you are debugging a particular problem.\n\n\t  Say N unless you are an XFS developer, or you play one on TV.\n\nconfig XFS_ASSERT_FATAL\n\tbool \"XFS fatal asserts\"\n\tdefault y\n\tdepends on XFS_FS && XFS_DEBUG\n\thelp\n\t  Set the default DEBUG mode ASSERT failure behavior.\n\n\t  Say Y here to cause DEBUG mode ASSERT failures to result in fatal\n\t  errors that BUG() the kernel by default. If you say N, ASSERT failures\n\t  result in warnings.\n\n\t  This behavior can be modified at runtime via sysfs.\n",
