CramFs is designed to be a simple, small, and compressed\n\t  file system for ROM based embedded systems.  CramFs is read-only,\n\t  limited to 256MB file systems (with 16MB files), and doesn't support\n\t  16/32 bits uid/gid, hard links and timestamps.\n\n\t  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/cramfs.rst> and\n\t  <file:fs/cramfs/README> for further information.\n\n\t  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called\n\t  cramfs.  Note that the root file system (the one containing the\n\t  directory /) cannot be compiled as a module.\n\n\t  This filesystem is limited in capabilities and performance on\n\t  purpose to remain small and low on RAM usage. It is most suitable\n\t  for small embedded systems. If you have ample RAM to spare, you may\n\t  consider a more capable compressed filesystem such as SquashFS\n\t  which is much better in terms of performance and features.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig CRAMFS_BLOCKDEV\n\tbool \"Support CramFs image over a regular block device\" if EXPERT\n\tdepends on CRAMFS && BLOCK\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  This option allows the CramFs driver to load data from a regular\n\t  block device such a disk partition or a ramdisk.\n\nconfig CRAMFS_MTD\n\tbool \"Support CramFs image directly mapped in physical memory\"\n\tdepends on CRAMFS && CRAMFS <= MTD\n\tdefault y if !CRAMFS_BLOCKDEV\n\thelp\n\t  This option allows the CramFs driver to load data directly from\n\t  a linear addressed memory range (usually non-volatile memory\n\t  like flash) instead of going through the block device layer.\n\t  This saves some memory since no intermediate buffering is\n\t  necessary.\n\n\t  The location of the CramFs image is determined by a\n\t  MTD device capable of direct memory mapping e.g. from\n\t  the 'physmap' map driver or a resulting MTD partition.\n\t  For example, this would mount the cramfs image stored in\n\t  the MTD partition named \"xip_fs\" on the /mnt mountpoint:\n\n\t  mount -t cramfs mtd:xip_fs /mnt\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n",
