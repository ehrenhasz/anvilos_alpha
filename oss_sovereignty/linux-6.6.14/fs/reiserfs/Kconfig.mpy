If you are still using it, please migrate to another\n\t  filesystem or tell us your usecase for reiserfs.\n\n\t  Reiserfs stores not just filenames but the files themselves in a\n\t  balanced tree.  Uses journalling.\n\n\t  Balanced trees are more efficient than traditional file system\n\t  architectural foundations.\n\n\t  In general, ReiserFS is as fast as ext2, but is very efficient with\n\t  large directories and small files.  Additional patches are needed\n\t  for NFS and quotas, please see \n\t  <https://reiser4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page> for links.\n\n\t  It is more easily extended to have features currently found in\n\t  database and keyword search systems than block allocation based file\n\t  systems are.  The next version will be so extended, and will support\n\t  plugins consistent with our motto ``It takes more than a license to\n\t  make source code open.''\n\n\t  Read <https://reiser4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page> \n\t  to learn more about reiserfs.\n\n\t  Sponsored by Threshold Networks, Emusic.com, and Bigstorage.com.\n\n\t  If you like it, you can pay us to add new features to it that you\n\t  need, buy a support contract, or pay us to port it to another OS.\n\nconfig REISERFS_CHECK\n\tbool \"Enable reiserfs debug mode\"\n\tdepends on REISERFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  If you set this to Y, then ReiserFS will perform every check it can\n\t  possibly imagine of its internal consistency throughout its\n\t  operation.  It will also go substantially slower.  More than once we\n\t  have forgotten that this was on, and then gone despondent over the\n\t  latest benchmarks.:-) Use of this option allows our team to go all\n\t  out in checking for consistency when debugging without fear of its\n\t  effect on end users.  If you are on the verge of sending in a bug\n\t  report, say Y and you might get a useful error message.  Almost\n\t  everyone should say N.\n\nconfig REISERFS_PROC_INFO\n\tbool \"Stats in /proc/fs/reiserfs\"\n\tdepends on REISERFS_FS && PROC_FS\n\thelp\n\t  Create under /proc/fs/reiserfs a hierarchy of files, displaying\n\t  various ReiserFS statistics and internal data at the expense of\n\t  making your kernel or module slightly larger (+8 KB). This also\n\t  increases the amount of kernel memory required for each mount.\n\t  Almost everyone but ReiserFS developers and people fine-tuning\n\t  reiserfs or tracing problems should say N.\n\nconfig REISERFS_FS_XATTR\n\tbool \"ReiserFS extended attributes\"\n\tdepends on REISERFS_FS\n\thelp\n\t  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by\n\t  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page for details).\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig REISERFS_FS_POSIX_ACL\n\tbool \"ReiserFS POSIX Access Control Lists\"\n\tdepends on REISERFS_FS_XATTR\n\tselect FS_POSIX_ACL\n\thelp\n\t  Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and\n\t  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.\n\n\t  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N\n\nconfig REISERFS_FS_SECURITY\n\tbool \"ReiserFS Security Labels\"\n\tdepends on REISERFS_FS_XATTR\n\thelp\n\t  Security labels support alternative access control models\n\t  implemented by security modules like SELinux.  This option\n\t  enables an extended attribute handler for file security\n\t  labels in the ReiserFS filesystem.\n\n\t  If you are not using a security module that requires using\n\t  extended attributes for file security labels, say N.\n",
