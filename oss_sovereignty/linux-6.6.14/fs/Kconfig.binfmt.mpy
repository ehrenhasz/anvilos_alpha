Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries\n\t  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all\n\t  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)\n\t  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able\n\t  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems\n\t  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new\n\t  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely\n\t  want to say Y here.\n\n\t  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.\n\n\t  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y\n\t  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then\n\t  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including\n\t  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and\n\t  latest version).\n\nconfig BINFMT_ELF_KUNIT_TEST\n\tbool \"Build KUnit tests for ELF binary support\" if !KUNIT_ALL_TESTS\n\tdepends on KUNIT=y && BINFMT_ELF=y\n\tdefault KUNIT_ALL_TESTS\n\thelp\n\t  This builds the ELF loader KUnit tests, which try to gather\n\t  prior bug fixes into a regression test collection. This is really\n\t  only needed for debugging. Note that with CONFIG_COMPAT=y, the\n\t  compat_binfmt_elf KUnit test is also created.\n\nconfig COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF\n\tdef_bool y\n\tdepends on COMPAT && BINFMT_ELF\n\tselect ELFCORE\n\nconfig ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_STATE\n\tbool\n\nconfig ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_EXTRA_PHDRS\n\tbool\n\nconfig ARCH_HAVE_ELF_PROT\n\tbool\n\nconfig ARCH_USE_GNU_PROPERTY\n\tbool\n\nconfig BINFMT_ELF_FDPIC\n\tbool \"Kernel support for FDPIC ELF binaries\"\n\tdefault y if !BINFMT_ELF\n\tdepends on ARM || ((M68K || RISCV || SUPERH || XTENSA) && !MMU)\n\tselect ELFCORE\n\thelp\n\t  ELF FDPIC binaries are based on ELF, but allow the individual load\n\t  segments of a binary to be located in memory independently of each\n\t  other. This makes this format ideal for use in environments where no\n\t  MMU is available as it still permits text segments to be shared,\n\t  even if data segments are not.\n\n\t  It is also possible to run FDPIC ELF binaries on MMU linux also.\n\nconfig ELFCORE\n\tbool\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables kernel/elfcore.o.\n\nconfig CORE_DUMP_DEFAULT_ELF_HEADERS\n\tbool \"Write ELF core dumps with partial segments\"\n\tdefault y\n\tdepends on BINFMT_ELF && ELF_CORE\n\thelp\n\t  ELF core dump files describe each memory mapping of the crashed\n\t  process, and can contain or omit the memory contents of each one.\n\t  The contents of an unmodified text mapping are omitted by default.\n\n\t  For an unmodified text mapping of an ELF object, including just\n\t  the first page of the file in a core dump makes it possible to\n\t  identify the build ID bits in the file, without paying the i/o\n\t  cost and disk space to dump all the text.  However, versions of\n\t  GDB before 6.7 are confused by ELF core dump files in this format.\n\n\t  The core dump behavior can be controlled per process using\n\t  the /proc/PID/coredump_filter pseudo-file; this setting is\n\t  inherited.  See Documentation/filesystems/proc.rst for details.\n\n\t  This config option changes the default setting of coredump_filter\n\t  seen at boot time.  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig BINFMT_SCRIPT\n\ttristate \"Kernel support for scripts starting with #!\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to execute interpreted scripts starting with\n\t  #! followed by the path to an interpreter.\n\n\t  You can build this support as a module; however, until that module\n\t  gets loaded, you cannot run scripts.  Thus, if you want to load this\n\t  module from an initramfs, the portion of the initramfs before loading\n\t  this module must consist of compiled binaries only.\n\n\t  Most systems will not boot if you say M or N here.  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig ARCH_HAS_BINFMT_FLAT\n\tbool\n\nconfig BINFMT_FLAT\n\tbool \"Kernel support for flat binaries\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_HAS_BINFMT_FLAT\n\thelp\n\t  Support uClinux FLAT format binaries.\n\nconfig BINFMT_FLAT_ARGVP_ENVP_ON_STACK\n\tbool\n\nconfig BINFMT_FLAT_OLD_ALWAYS_RAM\n\tbool\n\nconfig BINFMT_FLAT_NO_DATA_START_OFFSET\n\tbool\n\nconfig BINFMT_FLAT_OLD\n\tbool \"Enable support for very old legacy flat binaries\"\n\tdepends on BINFMT_FLAT\n\thelp\n\t  Support decade old uClinux FLAT format binaries.  Unless you know\n\t  you have some of those say N here.\n\nconfig BINFMT_ZFLAT\n\tbool \"Enable ZFLAT support\"\n\tdepends on BINFMT_FLAT\n\tselect ZLIB_INFLATE\n\thelp\n\t  Support FLAT format compressed binaries\n\nconfig BINFMT_MISC\n\ttristate \"Kernel support for MISC binaries\"\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary\n\t  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use\n\t  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python, .NET or\n\t  Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under\n\t  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have\n\t  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of\n\t  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux\n\t  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.\n\n\t  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file\n\t  <file:Documentation/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.rst> to learn how to use this\n\t  feature, <file:Documentation/admin-guide/java.rst> for information about how\n\t  to include Java support. and <file:Documentation/admin-guide/mono.rst> for\n          information about how to include Mono-based .NET support.\n\n          To use binfmt_misc, you will need to mount it:\n\t\tmount binfmt_misc -t binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc\n\n\t  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when\n\t  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc. If you\n\t  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.\n\nconfig COREDUMP\n\tbool \"Enable core dump support\" if EXPERT\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables support for performing core dumps. You almost\n\t  certainly want to say Y here. Not necessary on systems that never\n\t  need debugging or only ever run flawless code.\n\nendmenu\n",
