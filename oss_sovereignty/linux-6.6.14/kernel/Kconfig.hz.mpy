It is customary\n\t to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 Hz but 100 Hz may be more\n\t beneficial for servers and NUMA systems that do not need to have\n\t a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus\n\t contention and cacheline bounces as a result of timer interrupts.\n\t Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP\n\t environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts\n\t per second.\n\n\n\tconfig HZ_100\n\t\tbool \"100 HZ\"\n\thelp\n\t  100 Hz is a typical choice for servers, SMP and NUMA systems\n\t  with lots of processors that may show reduced performance if\n\t  too many timer interrupts are occurring.\n\n\tconfig HZ_250\n\t\tbool \"250 HZ\"\n\thelp\n\t 250 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance\n\t while also showing good interactive responsiveness even\n\t on SMP and NUMA systems.
