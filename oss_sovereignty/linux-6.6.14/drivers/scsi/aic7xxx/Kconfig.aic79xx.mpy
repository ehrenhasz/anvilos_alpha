The aic7xxx driver will automatically\n\tvary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a\n\tfixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum\n\tand display a console message indicating this value.\n\n\tDue to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using\n\ta high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation\n\tfailures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason,\n\tthe default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higher performance\n\ton some devices.  The upper bound is 253.  0 disables tagged queueing.\n\n\tPer device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line\n\t\"tag_info\" option.  See Documentation/scsi/aic79xx.rst for details.\n\nconfig AIC79XX_RESET_DELAY_MS\n\tint \"Initial bus reset delay in milli-seconds\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC79XX\n\tdefault \"5000\"\n\thelp\n\tThe number of milliseconds to delay after an initial bus reset.\n\tThe bus settle delay following all error recovery actions is\n\tdictated by the SCSI layer and is not affected by this value.\n\n\tDefault: 5000 (5 seconds)\n\nconfig AIC79XX_BUILD_FIRMWARE\n\tbool \"Build Adapter Firmware with Kernel Build\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC79XX && !PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD\n\thelp\n\tThis option should only be enabled if you are modifying the firmware\n\tsource to the aic79xx driver and wish to have the generated firmware\n\tinclude files updated during a normal kernel build.  The assembler\n\tfor the firmware requires lex and yacc or their equivalents, as well\n\tas the db v1 library.  You may have to install additional packages\n\tor modify the assembler Makefile or the files it includes if your\n\tbuild environment is different than that of the author.\n\nconfig AIC79XX_DEBUG_ENABLE\n\tbool \"Compile in Debugging Code\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC79XX\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\tCompile in aic79xx debugging code that can be useful in diagnosing\n\tdriver errors.\n\nconfig AIC79XX_DEBUG_MASK\n\tint \"Debug code enable mask (16383 for all debugging)\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC79XX\n\tdefault \"0\"\n\thelp\n\tBit mask of debug options that is only valid if the\n\tCONFIG_AIC79XX_DEBUG_ENABLE option is enabled.  The bits in this mask\n\tare defined in the drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx.h - search for the\n\tvariable ahd_debug in that file to find them.\n\nconfig AIC79XX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT\n\tbool \"Decode registers during diagnostics\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC79XX\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\tCompile in register value tables for the output of expanded register\n\tcontents in diagnostics.
