For AAA and ARO based\n\tconfigurations, only SCSI functionality is provided.\n\n\tTo compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\tmodule will be called aic7xxx.\n\nconfig AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE\n\tint \"Maximum number of TCQ commands per device\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC7XXX\n\tdefault \"32\"\n\thelp\n\tSpecify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI\n\tdevice when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.\n\n\tThis is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions\n\tto be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically\n\tvary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a\n\tfixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum\n\tand display a console message indicating this value.\n\n\tDue to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using\n\ta high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation\n\tfailures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason,\n\tthe default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higher performance\n\ton some devices.  The upper bound is 253.  0 disables tagged queueing.\n\n\tPer device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line\n\t\"tag_info\" option.  See Documentation/scsi/aic7xxx.rst for details.\n\nconfig AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY_MS\n\tint \"Initial bus reset delay in milli-seconds\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC7XXX\n\tdefault \"5000\"\n\thelp\n\tThe number of milliseconds to delay after an initial bus reset.\n\tThe bus settle delay following all error recovery actions is\n\tdictated by the SCSI layer and is not affected by this value.\n\n\tDefault: 5000 (5 seconds)\n\nconfig AIC7XXX_BUILD_FIRMWARE\n\tbool \"Build Adapter Firmware with Kernel Build\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC7XXX && !PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD\n\thelp\n\tThis option should only be enabled if you are modifying the firmware\n\tsource to the aic7xxx driver and wish to have the generated firmware\n\tinclude files updated during a normal kernel build.  The assembler\n\tfor the firmware requires lex and yacc or their equivalents, as well\n\tas the db v1 library.  You may have to install additional packages\n\tor modify the assembler Makefile or the files it includes if your\n\tbuild environment is different than that of the author.\n\nconfig AIC7XXX_DEBUG_ENABLE\n\tbool \"Compile in Debugging Code\"\n\tdepends on SCSI_AIC7XXX\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\tCompile in aic7xxx debugging code that can be useful in diagnosing\n\tdriver errors.\n\nconfig AIC7XXX_DEBUG_MASK\n        int \"Debug code enable mask (2047 for all debugging)\"\n        depends on SCSI_AIC7XXX\n        default \"0\"\n        help\n\tBit mask of debug options that is only valid if the\n\tCONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_ENABLE option is enabled.  The bits in this mask\n\tare defined in the drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.h - search for the\n\tvariable ahc_debug in that file to find them.\n\nconfig AIC7XXX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT\n        bool \"Decode registers during diagnostics\"\n        depends on SCSI_AIC7XXX\n\tdefault y\n        help\n\tCompile in register value tables for the output of expanded register\n\tcontents in diagnostics.
