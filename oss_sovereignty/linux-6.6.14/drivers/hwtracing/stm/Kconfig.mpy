This was the protocol that the STM framework used\n\t  exclusively until the MIPI SyS-T support was added. Use this\n\t  driver for compatibility with your existing STM setup.\n\n\t  The receiving side only needs to be able to decode the MIPI\n\t  STP protocol in order to extract the data.\n\n\t  If you want to be able to use the basic protocol or want the\n\t  backwards compatibility for your existing setup, say Y.\n\nconfig STM_PROTO_SYS_T\n\ttristate \"MIPI SyS-T STM framing protocol driver\"\n\tdefault CONFIG_STM\n\thelp\n\t  This is an implementation of MIPI SyS-T protocol to be used\n\t  over the STP transport. In addition to the data payload, it\n\t  also carries additional metadata for time correlation, better\n\t  means of trace source identification, etc.\n\n\t  The receiving side must be able to decode this protocol in\n\t  addition to the MIPI STP, in order to extract the data.\n\n\t  If you don't know what this is, say N.\n\nconfig STM_DUMMY\n\ttristate \"Dummy STM driver\"\n\thelp\n\t  This is a simple dummy device that pretends to be an stm device\n\t  and discards your data. Use for stm class testing.\n\n\t  If you don't know what this is, say N.\n\nconfig STM_SOURCE_CONSOLE\n\ttristate \"Kernel console over STM devices\"\n\thelp\n\t  This is a kernel space trace source that sends kernel log\n\t  messages to trace hosts over STM devices.\n\n\t  If you want to send kernel console messages over STM devices,\n\t  say Y.\n\nconfig STM_SOURCE_HEARTBEAT\n\ttristate \"Heartbeat over STM devices\"\n\thelp\n\t  This is a kernel space trace source that sends periodic\n\t  heartbeat messages to trace hosts over STM devices. It is\n\t  also useful for testing stm class drivers and the stm class\n\t  framework itself.\n\n\t  If you want to send heartbeat messages over STM devices,\n\t  say Y.\n\nconfig STM_SOURCE_FTRACE\n\ttristate \"Copy the output from kernel Ftrace to STM engine\"\n\tdepends on TRACING\n\thelp\n\t  This option can be used to copy the output from kernel Ftrace\n\t  to STM engine. Enabling this option will introduce a slight\n\t  timing effect.\n\n\t  If you want to send kernel Ftrace messages over STM devices,\n\t  say Y.\n\nendif\n",
