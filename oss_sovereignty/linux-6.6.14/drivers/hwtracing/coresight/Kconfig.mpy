It's intended to build\n\t  a topological view of the CoreSight components based on a DT\n\t  specification and configure the right series of components when a\n\t  trace source gets enabled.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight.\n\nif CORESIGHT\nconfig CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\ttristate \"CoreSight Link and Sink drivers\"\n\thelp\n\t  This enables support for CoreSight link and sink drivers that are\n\t  responsible for transporting and collecting the trace data\n\t  respectively.  Link and sinks are dynamically aggregated with a trace\n\t  entity at run time to form a complete trace path.\n\n\t  To compile these drivers as modules, choose M here: the\n\t  modules will be called coresight-funnel and coresight-replicator.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_LINK_AND_SINK_TMC\n\ttristate \"Coresight generic TMC driver\"\n\n\tdepends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\thelp\n\t  This enables support for the Trace Memory Controller driver.\n\t  Depending on its configuration the device can act as a link (embedded\n\t  trace router - ETR) or sink (embedded trace FIFO).  The driver\n\t  complies with the generic implementation of the component without\n\t  special enhancement or added features.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight-tmc.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_CATU\n\ttristate \"Coresight Address Translation Unit (CATU) driver\"\n\tdepends on CORESIGHT_LINK_AND_SINK_TMC\n\thelp\n\t   Enable support for the Coresight Address Translation Unit (CATU).\n\t   CATU supports a scatter gather table of 4K pages, with forward/backward\n\t   lookup. CATU helps TMC ETR to use a large physically non-contiguous trace\n\t   buffer by translating the addresses used by ETR to the physical address\n\t   by looking up the provided table. CATU can also be used in pass-through\n\t   mode where the address is not translated.\n\n\t   To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t   module will be called coresight-catu.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_SINK_TPIU\n\ttristate \"Coresight generic TPIU driver\"\n\tdepends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\thelp\n\t  This enables support for the Trace Port Interface Unit driver,\n\t  responsible for bridging the gap between the on-chip coresight\n\t  components and a trace for bridging the gap between the on-chip\n\t  coresight components and a trace port collection engine, typically\n\t  connected to an external host for use case capturing more traces than\n\t  the on-board coresight memory can handle.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight-tpiu.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_SINK_ETBV10\n\ttristate \"Coresight ETBv1.0 driver\"\n\tdepends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\thelp\n\t  This enables support for the Embedded Trace Buffer version 1.0 driver\n\t  that complies with the generic implementation of the component without\n\t  special enhancement or added features.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight-etb10.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM3X\n\ttristate \"CoreSight Embedded Trace Macrocell 3.x driver\"\n\tdepends on !ARM64\n\tselect CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for processor ETM3.x and PTM1.x modules,\n\t  which allows tracing the instructions that a processor is executing\n\t  This is primarily useful for instruction level tracing.  Depending\n\t  the ETM version data tracing may also be available.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight-etm3x.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM4X\n\ttristate \"CoreSight ETMv4.x / ETE driver\"\n\tdepends on ARM64\n\tselect CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\tselect PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for the CoreSight Embedded Trace Macrocell\n\t  version 4.x and the Embedded Trace Extensions (ETE). Both are CPU tracer\n\t  modules, tracing the instructions that a processor is executing. This is\n\t  primarily useful for instruction level tracing.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight-etm4x.\n\nconfig ETM4X_IMPDEF_FEATURE\n\tbool \"Control implementation defined overflow support in ETM 4.x driver\"\n\tdepends on CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM4X\n\thelp\n\t  This control provides implementation define control for CoreSight\n\t  ETM 4.x tracer module that can't reduce commit rate automatically.\n\t  This avoids overflow between the ETM tracer module and the cpu core.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_STM\n\ttristate \"CoreSight System Trace Macrocell driver\"\n\tdepends on (ARM && !(CPU_32v3 || CPU_32v4 || CPU_32v4T)) || ARM64\n\tselect CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\tselect STM\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for hardware assisted software\n\t  instrumentation based tracing. This is primarily used for\n\t  logging useful software events or data coming from various entities\n\t  in the system, possibly running different OSs\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight-stm.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_CPU_DEBUG\n\ttristate \"CoreSight CPU Debug driver\"\n\tdepends on ARM || ARM64\n\tdepends on DEBUG_FS\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for coresight debugging module. This\n\t  is primarily used to dump sample-based profiling registers when\n\t  system triggers panic, the driver will parse context registers so\n\t  can quickly get to know program counter (PC), secure state,\n\t  exception level, etc. Before use debugging functionality, platform\n\t  needs to ensure the clock domain and power domain are enabled\n\t  properly, please refer Documentation/trace/coresight/coresight-cpu-debug.rst\n\t  for detailed description and the example for usage.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight-cpu-debug.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_CPU_DEBUG_DEFAULT_ON\n\tbool \"Enable CoreSight CPU Debug by default\"\n\tdepends on CORESIGHT_CPU_DEBUG\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to enable the CoreSight Debug panic-debug by default. This\n\t  can also be enabled via debugfs, but this ensures the debug feature\n\t  is enabled as early as possible.\n\n\t  Has the same effect as setting coresight_cpu_debug.enable=1 on the\n\t  kernel command line.\n\n\t  Say N if unsure.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_CTI\n\ttristate \"CoreSight Cross Trigger Interface (CTI) driver\"\n\tdepends on ARM || ARM64\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for CoreSight CTI and CTM components.\n\t  These provide hardware triggering events between CoreSight trace\n\t  source and sink components. These can be used to halt trace or\n\t  inject events into the trace stream. CTI also provides a software\n\t  control to trigger the same halt events. This can provide fast trace\n\t  halt compared to disabling sources and sinks normally in driver\n\t  software.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called coresight-cti.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_CTI_INTEGRATION_REGS\n\tbool \"Access CTI CoreSight Integration Registers\"\n\tdepends on CORESIGHT_CTI\n\thelp\n\t  This option adds support for the CoreSight integration registers on\n\t  this device. The integration registers allow the exploration of the\n\t  CTI trigger connections between this and other devices.These\n\t  registers are not used in normal operation and can leave devices in\n\t  an inconsistent state.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_TRBE\n\ttristate \"Trace Buffer Extension (TRBE) driver\"\n\tdepends on ARM64 && CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM4X\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for percpu Trace Buffer Extension (TRBE).\n\t  TRBE always needs to be used along with its corresponding percpu ETE\n\t  component. ETE generates trace data which is then captured with TRBE.\n\t  Unlike traditional sink devices, TRBE is a CPU feature accessible via\n\t  system registers. But its explicit dependency with trace unit (ETE)\n\t  requires it to be plugged in as a coresight sink device.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called coresight-trbe.\n\nconfig ULTRASOC_SMB\n\ttristate \"Ultrasoc system memory buffer drivers\"\n\tdepends on ACPI || COMPILE_TEST\n\tdepends on ARM64 && CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for the Ultrasoc system memory buffer (SMB).\n\t  SMB is responsible for receiving the trace data from Coresight ETM devices\n\t  and storing them to a system buffer.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called ultrasoc-smb.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_TPDM\n\ttristate \"CoreSight Trace, Profiling & Diagnostics Monitor driver\"\n\tselect CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS\n\tselect CORESIGHT_TPDA\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for configuring monitor. Monitors are\n\t  primarily responsible for data set collection and support the\n\t  ability to collect any permutation of data set types.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called coresight-tpdm.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_TPDA\n\ttristate \"CoreSight Trace, Profiling & Diagnostics Aggregator driver\"\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for configuring aggregator. This is\n\t  primarily useful for pulling the data sets from one or more\n\t  attached monitors and pushing the resultant data out. Multiple\n\t  monitors are connected on different input ports of TPDA.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called coresight-tpda.\n\nconfig CORESIGHT_DUMMY\n\ttristate \"Dummy driver support\"\n\thelp\n\t  Enables support for dummy driver. Dummy driver can be used for\n\t  CoreSight sources/sinks that are owned and configured by some\n\t  other subsystem and use Linux drivers to configure rest of trace\n\t  path.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called coresight-dummy.\nendif\n",
