For a manual compile, you may use a command line like the following:\n'linux/scripts/dtc/dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o pi433.dtbo pi433-overlay.dtso'\n\nFor compiling inside of the kernel tree, you need to copy pi433-overlay.dtso to\narch/arm/boot/dts/overlays and you need to add the file to the list of files\nin the Makefile over there. Execute 'make dtbs' in kernel tree root to make the\nkernel make files compile the device tree overlay for you.\n\n\n",
