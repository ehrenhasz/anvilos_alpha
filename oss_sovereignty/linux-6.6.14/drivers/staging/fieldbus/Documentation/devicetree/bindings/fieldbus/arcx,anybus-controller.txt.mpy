It is\nexpected that its Device Tree node is specified as the child of a node\ncorresponding to the parallel bus used for communication.\n\nRequired properties:\n--------------------\n\n  - compatible : The following chip-specific string:\n        \"arcx,anybus-controller\"\n\n  - reg : three areas:\n\tindex 0: bus memory area where the cpld registers are located.\n\tindex 1: bus memory area of the first  host's dual-port ram.\n\tindex 2: bus memory area of the second host's dual-port ram.\n\n  - reset-gpios : the GPIO pin connected to the reset line of the controller.\n\n  - interrupts : two interrupts:\n\t\tindex 0: interrupt connected to the first  host\n\t\tindex 1: interrupt connected to the second host\n\tGeneric interrupt client node bindings are described in\n\tinterrupt-controller/interrupts.txt\n\nOptional: use of subnodes\n-------------------------\n\nThe card connected to a host may need additional properties. These can be\nspecified in subnodes to the controller node.\n\nThe subnodes are identified by the standard 'reg' property. Which information\nexactly can be specified depends on the bindings for the function driver\nfor the subnode.\n\nRequired controller node properties when using subnodes:\n- #address-cells: should be one.\n- #size-cells: should be zero.\n\nRequired subnode properties:\n- reg: Must contain the host index of the card this subnode describes:\n\t\t<0>\tfor the first  host on the controller\n\t\t<1>\tfor the second host on the controller\n\tNote that only a single card can be plugged into a host, so the host\n\tindex uniquely describes the card location.\n\nExample of usage:\n-----------------\n\nThis example places the bridge on top of the i.MX WEIM parallel bus, see:\nDocumentation/devicetree/bindings/bus/imx-weim.txt\n\n&weim {\n\tcontroller@0,0 {\n\t\tcompatible = \"arcx,anybus-controller\";\n\t\treg = <0 0 0x100>, <0 0x400000 0x800>, <1 0x400000 0x800>;\n\t\treset-gpios = <&gpio5 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;\n\t\tinterrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;\n\t\tinterrupts = <1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>, <5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;\n\t\t/* fsl,weim-cs-timing is a i.MX WEIM bus specific property */\n\t\tfsl,weim-cs-timing = <0x024400b1 0x00001010 0x20081100\n\t\t\t\t0x00000000 0xa0000240 0x00000000>;\n\t\t/* optional subnode for a card plugged into the first host */\n\t\t#address-cells = <1>;\n\t\t#size-cells = <0>;\n\t\tcard@0 {\n\t\t\treg = <0>;\n\t\t\t/* card specific properties go here */\n\t\t};\n\t};\n};\n",
