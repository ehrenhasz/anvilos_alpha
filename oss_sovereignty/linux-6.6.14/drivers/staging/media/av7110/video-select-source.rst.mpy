This ioctl was also supported by the\nV4L2 ivtv driver, but that has been replaced by the ivtv-specific\n``IVTV_IOC_PASSTHROUGH_MODE`` ioctl.\n\nThis ioctl call informs the video device which source shall be used for\nthe input data. The possible sources are demux or memory. If memory is\nselected, the data is fed to the video device through the write command.\n\n.. c:type:: video_stream_source_t\n\n.. code-block:: c\n\n\ttypedef enum {\n\t\tVIDEO_SOURCE_DEMUX, /* Select the demux as the main source */\n\t\tVIDEO_SOURCE_MEMORY /* If this source is selected, the stream\n\t\t\t\tcomes from the user through the write\n\t\t\t\tsystem call */\n\t} video_stream_source_t;\n\nReturn Value\n------------\n\nOn success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set\nappropriately.
