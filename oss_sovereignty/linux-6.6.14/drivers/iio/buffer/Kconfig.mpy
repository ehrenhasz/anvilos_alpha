That is, those where the data is pushed to the consumer.\n\nconfig IIO_BUFFER_DMA\n\ttristate \"Industrial I/O DMA buffer infrastructure\"\n\thelp\n\t  Provides the generic IIO DMA buffer infrastructure that can be used by\n\t  drivers for devices with DMA support to implement the IIO buffer.\n\n\t  Should be selected by drivers that want to use the generic DMA buffer\n\t  infrastructure.\n\nconfig IIO_BUFFER_DMAENGINE\n\ttristate \"Industrial I/O DMA buffer integration with DMAEngine\"\n\tselect IIO_BUFFER_DMA\n\thelp\n\t  Provides a bonding of the generic IIO DMA buffer infrastructure with the\n\t  DMAEngine framework. This can be used by converter drivers with a DMA port\n\t  connected to an external DMA controller which is supported by the\n\t  DMAEngine framework.\n\n\t  Should be selected by drivers that want to use this functionality.\n\nconfig IIO_BUFFER_HW_CONSUMER\n\ttristate \"Industrial I/O HW buffering\"\n\thelp\n\t  Provides a way to bonding when an IIO device has a direct connection\n\t  to another device in hardware. In this case buffers for data transfers\n\t  are handled by hardware.\n\n\t  Should be selected by drivers that want to use the generic Hw consumer\n\t  interface.\n\nconfig IIO_KFIFO_BUF\n\ttristate \"Industrial I/O buffering based on kfifo\"\n\thelp\n\t  A simple fifo based on kfifo.  Note that this currently provides\n\t  no buffer events so it is up to userspace to work out how\n\t  often to read from the buffer.\n\nconfig IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER\n\ttristate \"Industrial I/O triggered buffer support\"\n\tselect IIO_TRIGGER\n\tselect IIO_KFIFO_BUF\n\thelp\n\t  Provides helper functions for setting up triggered buffers.\n",
