Userland can use it to get a high-precision time\n\t  reference.\n\n\t  Some antennae's PPS signals are connected with the CD (Carrier\n\t  Detect) pin of the serial line they use to communicate with the\n\t  host. In this case use the SERIAL_LINE client support.\n\n\t  Some antennae's PPS signals are connected with some special host\n\t  inputs so you have to enable the corresponding client support.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called pps_core.ko.\n\nif PPS\n\nconfig PPS_DEBUG\n\tbool \"PPS debugging messages\"\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want the PPS support to produce a bunch of debug\n\t  messages to the system log.
