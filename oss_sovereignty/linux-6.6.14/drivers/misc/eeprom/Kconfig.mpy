Use these generic chip names, instead of vendor-specific\n\t  ones like at24c64, 24lc02 or fm24c04:\n\n\t     24c00, 24c01, 24c02, spd (readonly 24c02), 24c04, 24c08,\n\t     24c16, 24c32, 24c64, 24c128, 24c256, 24c512, 24c1024, 24c2048\n\n\t  Unless you like data loss puzzles, always be sure that any chip\n\t  you configure as a 24c32 (32 kbit) or larger is NOT really a\n\t  24c16 (16 kbit) or smaller, and vice versa. Marking the chip\n\t  as read-only won't help recover from this. Also, if your chip\n\t  has any software write-protect mechanism you may want to review the\n\t  code to make sure this driver won't turn it on by accident.\n\n\t  If you use this with an SMBus adapter instead of an I2C adapter,\n\t  full functionality is not available.  Only smaller devices are\n\t  supported (24c16 and below, max 4 kByte).\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module\n\t  will be called at24.\n\nconfig EEPROM_AT25\n\ttristate \"SPI EEPROMs (FRAMs) from most vendors\"\n\tdepends on SPI && SYSFS\n\tselect NVMEM\n\tselect NVMEM_SYSFS\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this driver to get read/write support to most SPI EEPROMs\n\t  and Cypress FRAMs,\n\t  after you configure the board init code to know about each eeprom\n\t  on your target board.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module.

Such\n\t  EEPROMs could theoretically be available on other devices as well.\n\n\t  This driver is deprecated and will be removed soon, please use the\n\t  better at24 driver instead.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module.

You have to additionally select Microwire\n\t  EEPROM 93XX46 driver. sysfs entries will be created for that\n\t  EEPROM allowing to read/write the configuration data or to\n\t  erase the whole EEPROM.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig EEPROM_IDT_89HPESX\n\ttristate \"IDT 89HPESx PCIe-swtiches EEPROM / CSR support\"\n\tdepends on I2C && SYSFS\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this driver to get read/write access to EEPROM / CSRs\n\t  over IDT PCIe-swtich i2c-slave interface.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module.
