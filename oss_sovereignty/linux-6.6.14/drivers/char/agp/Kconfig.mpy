This code acts\n\t  as a sort of \"AGP driver\" for the motherboard's chipset.\n\n\t  If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART\n\t  (theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB\n\t  due to kernel allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses\n\t  and have up to a couple gigs of texture space.\n\n\t  Note that this is the only means to have X/GLX use\n\t  write-combining with MTRR support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL\n\t  direct rendering will be a lot slower but still faster than PIO.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called agpgart.\n\n\t  You should say Y here if you want to use GLX or DRI.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig AGP_ALI\n\ttristate \"ALI chipset support\"\n\tdepends on AGP && X86_32\n\thelp\n\t  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of\n\t  X on the following ALi chipsets.  The supported chipsets\n\t  include M1541, M1621, M1631, M1632, M1641,M1647,and M1651.\n\t  For the ALi-chipset question, ALi suggests you refer to\n\t  <http://www.ali.com.tw/>.\n\n\t  The M1541 chipset can do AGP 1x and 2x, but note that there is an\n\t  acknowledged incompatibility with Matrox G200 cards. Due to\n\t  timing issues, this chipset cannot do AGP 2x with the G200.\n\t  This is a hardware limitation. AGP 1x seems to be fine, though.\n\nconfig AGP_ATI\n\ttristate \"ATI chipset support\"\n\tdepends on AGP && X86_32\n\thelp\n\t  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of\n\t  X on the ATI RadeonIGP family of chipsets.\n\nconfig AGP_AMD\n\ttristate \"AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 chipset support\"\n\tdepends on AGP && X86_32\n\thelp\n\t  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of\n\t  X on AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 chipsets.\n\nconfig AGP_AMD64\n\ttristate \"AMD Opteron/Athlon64 on-CPU GART support\"\n\tdepends on AGP && X86 && AMD_NB\n\thelp\n\t  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of\n\t  X using the on-CPU northbridge of the AMD Athlon64/Opteron CPUs.\n\t  You still need an external AGP bridge like the AMD 8151, VIA\n\t  K8T400M, SiS755. It may also support other AGP bridges when loaded\n\t  with agp_try_unsupported=1.\n\nconfig AGP_INTEL\n\ttristate \"Intel 440LX/BX/GX, I8xx and E7x05 chipset support\"\n\tdepends on AGP && X86\n\tselect INTEL_GTT\n\thelp\n\t  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X\n\t  on Intel 440LX/BX/GX, 815, 820, 830, 840, 845, 850, 860, 875,\n\t  E7205 and E7505 chipsets and full support for the 810, 815, 830M,\n\t  845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G and I915 integrated graphics chipsets.\n\n\n\nconfig AGP_NVIDIA\n\ttristate \"NVIDIA nForce/nForce2 chipset support\"\n\tdepends on AGP && X86_32\n\thelp\n\t  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of\n\t  X on NVIDIA chipsets including nForce and nForce2\n\nconfig AGP_SIS\n\ttristate \"SiS chipset support\"\n\tdepends on AGP && X86\n\thelp\n\t  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of\n\t  X on Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] chipsets.\n\n\t  Note that 5591/5592 AGP chipsets are NOT supported.\n\n\nconfig AGP_SWORKS\n\ttristate \"Serverworks LE/HE chipset support\"\n\tdepends on AGP && X86_32\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to support the Serverworks AGP card.
