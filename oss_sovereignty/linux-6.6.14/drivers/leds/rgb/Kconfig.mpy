The LPG consists of a number of PWM\n\t  channels and typically a shared pattern lookup table and a current\n\t  sink, intended to drive RGB LEDs. Each channel can either be used as\n\t  a LED, grouped to represent a RGB LED or exposed as PWM channels.\n\n\t  If compiled as a module, the module will be named leds-qcom-lpg.\n\nconfig LEDS_MT6370_RGB\n\ttristate \"LED Support for MediaTek MT6370 PMIC\"\n\tdepends on MFD_MT6370\n\tselect LINEAR_RANGES\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to enable support for MT6370_RGB LED device.\n\t  In MT6370, there are four channel current-sink LED drivers that\n\t  support hardware pattern for constant current, PWM, and breath mode.\n\t  Isink4 channel can also be used as a CHG_VIN power good indicator.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module\n\t  will be called \"leds-mt6370-rgb\".\n\nendif # LEDS_CLASS_MULTICOLOR\n",
