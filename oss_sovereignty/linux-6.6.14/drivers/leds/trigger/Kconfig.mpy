If unsure, say Y.\n\nif LEDS_TRIGGERS\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_TIMER\n\ttristate \"LED Timer Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a programmable timer\n\t  via sysfs. Some LED hardware can be programmed to start\n\t  blinking the LED without any further software interaction.\n\t  For more details read Documentation/leds/leds-class.rst.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_ONESHOT\n\ttristate \"LED One-shot Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to blink in one-shot pulses with parameters\n\t  controlled via sysfs.  It's useful to notify the user on\n\t  sporadic events, when there are no clear begin and end trap points,\n\t  or on dense events, where this blinks the LED at constant rate if\n\t  rearmed continuously.\n\n\t  It also shows how to use the led_blink_set_oneshot() function.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_DISK\n\tbool \"LED Disk Trigger\"\n\tdepends on ATA\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by disk activity.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_MTD\n\tbool \"LED MTD (NAND/NOR) Trigger\"\n\tdepends on MTD\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by MTD activity.\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_HEARTBEAT\n\ttristate \"LED Heartbeat Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a CPU load average.\n\t  The flash frequency is a hyperbolic function of the 1-minute\n\t  load average.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_BACKLIGHT\n\ttristate \"LED backlight Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled as a backlight device: they\n\t  turn off and on when the display is blanked and unblanked.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_CPU\n\tbool \"LED CPU Trigger\"\n\tdepends on !PREEMPT_RT\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by active CPUs. This shows\n\t  the active CPUs across an array of LEDs so you can see which\n\t  CPUs are active on the system at any given moment.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_ACTIVITY\n\ttristate \"LED activity Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by an immediate CPU usage.\n\t  The flash frequency and duty cycle varies from faint flashes to\n\t  intense brightness depending on the instant CPU load.\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_GPIO\n\ttristate \"LED GPIO Trigger\"\n\tdepends on GPIOLIB || COMPILE_TEST\n\tdepends on BROKEN\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by gpio events. It's good\n\t  when using gpios as switches and triggering the needed LEDs\n\t  from there. One use case is n810's keypad LEDs that could\n\t  be triggered by this trigger when user slides up to show\n\t  keypad.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_DEFAULT_ON\n\ttristate \"LED Default ON Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be initialised in the ON state.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\ncomment \"iptables trigger is under Netfilter config (LED target)\"\n\tdepends on LEDS_TRIGGERS\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_TRANSIENT\n\ttristate \"LED Transient Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows one time activation of a transient state on\n\t  GPIO/PWM based hardware.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_CAMERA\n\ttristate \"LED Camera Flash/Torch Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled as a camera flash/torch device.\n\t  This enables direct flash/torch on/off by the driver, kernel space.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_PANIC\n\tbool \"LED Panic Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be configured to blink on a kernel panic.\n\t  Enabling this option will allow to mark certain LEDs as panic indicators,\n\t  allowing to blink them on a kernel panic, even if they are set to\n\t  a different trigger.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_NETDEV\n\ttristate \"LED Netdev Trigger\"\n\tdepends on NET\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by network device activity.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_PATTERN\n\ttristate \"LED Pattern Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a software or hardware pattern\n\t  which is a series of tuples, of brightness and duration (ms).\n\t  If unsure, say N\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_AUDIO\n\ttristate \"Audio Mute LED Trigger\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by audio drivers for following\n\t  the audio mute and mic-mute changes.\n\t  If unsure, say N\n\nconfig LEDS_TRIGGER_TTY\n\ttristate \"LED Trigger for TTY devices\"\n\tdepends on TTY\n\thelp\n\t  This allows LEDs to be controlled by activity on ttys which includes\n\t  serial devices like /dev/ttyS0.\n\n\t  When build as a module this driver will be called ledtrig-tty.\n\nendif # LEDS_TRIGGERS\n",
