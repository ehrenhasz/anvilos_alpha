Do NOT enable in production kernels.\n\nconfig HVC_DCC\n\tbool \"ARM JTAG DCC console\"\n\tdepends on ARM || ARM64\n\tselect HVC_DRIVER\n\tselect SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE\n\thelp\n\t  This console uses the JTAG DCC on ARM to create a console under the HVC\n\t  driver. This console is used through a JTAG only on ARM. If you don't have\n\t  a JTAG then you probably don't want this option.\n\nconfig HVC_DCC_SERIALIZE_SMP\n\tbool \"Use DCC only on CPU core 0\"\n\tdepends on SMP && HVC_DCC\n\thelp\n\t  This is a DEBUG option to serialize all console input and output to CPU 0.\n\t  Some external debuggers, do not handle reads/writes from/to DCC on more\n\t  than one CPU core. Each core has its own DCC device registers, so when a\n\t  CPU core reads or writes from/to DCC, it only accesses its own DCC device.\n\t  Since kernel code can run on any CPU core, every time the kernel wants to\n\t  write to the console, it might write to a different DCC.\n\n\t  In SMP mode, external debuggers create multiple windows, and each window\n\t  shows the DCC output only from that core's DCC. The result is that\n\t  console output is either lost or scattered across windows.\n\n\t  Enable this option only if you are sure that you do not need features like\n\t  CPU hotplug to work. For example, during early chipset bringups without\n\t  debug serial console support. If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig HVC_RISCV_SBI\n\tbool \"RISC-V SBI console support\"\n\tdepends on RISCV_SBI_V01\n\tselect HVC_DRIVER\n\thelp\n\t  This enables support for console output via RISC-V SBI calls, which\n\t  is normally used only during boot to output printk.\n\n\t  If you don't know what do to here, say Y.\n\nconfig HVCS\n\ttristate \"IBM Hypervisor Virtual Console Server support\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PSERIES && HVC_CONSOLE\n\thelp\n\t  Partitionable IBM Power5 ppc64 machines allow hosting of\n\t  firmware virtual consoles from one Linux partition by\n\t  another Linux partition.  This driver allows console data\n\t  from Linux partitions to be accessed through TTY device\n\t  interfaces in the device tree of a Linux partition running\n\t  this driver.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called hvcs.  Additionally, this module\n\t  will depend on arch specific APIs exported from hvcserver.ko\n\t  which will also be compiled when this driver is built as a\n\t  module.\n",
