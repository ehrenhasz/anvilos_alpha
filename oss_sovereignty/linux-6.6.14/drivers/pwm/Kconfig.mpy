Applications include efficient\n\t  power delivery and voltage regulation. In computer systems,\n\t  PWMs are commonly used to control fans or the brightness of\n\t  display backlights.\n\n\t  This framework provides a generic interface to PWM devices\n\t  within the Linux kernel. On the driver side it provides an API\n\t  to register and unregister a PWM chip, an abstraction of a PWM\n\t  controller, that supports one or more PWM devices. Client\n\t  drivers can request PWM devices and use the generic framework\n\t  to configure as well as enable and disable them.\n\n\t  This generic framework replaces the legacy PWM framework which\n\t  allows only a single driver implementing the required API. Not\n\t  all legacy implementations have been ported to the framework\n\t  yet. The framework provides an API that is backward compatible\n\t  with the legacy framework so that existing client drivers\n\t  continue to work as expected.\n\n\t  If unsure, say no.\n\nif PWM\n\nconfig PWM_SYSFS\n\tbool\n\tdefault y if SYSFS\n\nconfig PWM_DEBUG\n\tbool \"PWM lowlevel drivers additional checks and debug messages\"\n\tdepends on DEBUG_KERNEL\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables some additional checks to help lowlevel driver\n\t  authors to get their callbacks implemented correctly.\n\t  It is expected to introduce some runtime overhead and diagnostic\n\t  output to the kernel log, so only enable while working on a driver.\n\nconfig PWM_AB8500\n\ttristate \"AB8500 PWM support\"\n\tdepends on AB8500_CORE && ARCH_U8500\n\thelp\n\t  Generic PWM framework driver for Analog Baseband AB8500.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called pwm-ab8500.\n\nconfig PWM_APPLE\n\ttristate \"Apple SoC PWM support\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_APPLE || COMPILE_TEST\n\thelp\n\t  Generic PWM framework driver for PWM controller present on\n\t  Apple SoCs\n\n\t  Say Y here if you have an ARM Apple laptop, otherwise say N\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called pwm-apple.\n\nconfig PWM_ATMEL\n\ttristate \"Atmel PWM support\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_AT91 || COMPILE_TEST\n\tdepends on HAS_IOMEM && OF\n\thelp\n\t  Generic PWM framework driver for Atmel SoC.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called pwm-atmel.\n\nconfig PWM_ATMEL_HLCDC_PWM\n\ttristate \"Atmel HLCDC PWM support\"\n\tdepends on MFD_ATMEL_HLCDC\n\tdepends on HAVE_CLK\n\thelp\n\t  Generic PWM framework driver for the PWM output of the HLCDC\n\t  (Atmel High-end LCD Controller).
