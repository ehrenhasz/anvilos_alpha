The term \"HID\"\n\t  most commonly used to refer to the USB-HID specification, but other\n\t  devices (such as, but not strictly limited to, Bluetooth) are\n\t  designed using HID specification (this involves certain keyboards,\n\t  mice, tablets, etc). This option adds the HID bus to the kernel,\n\t  together with generic HID layer code. The HID devices are added and\n\t  removed from the HID bus by the transport-layer drivers, such as\n\t  usbhid (USB_HID) and hidp (BT_HIDP).\n\n\t  For docs and specs, see https://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nif HID\n\nconfig HID_BATTERY_STRENGTH\n\tbool \"Battery level reporting for HID devices\"\n\tselect POWER_SUPPLY\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\tThis option adds support of reporting battery strength (for HID devices\n\tthat support this feature) through power_supply class so that userspace\n\ttools, such as upower, can display it.\n\nconfig HIDRAW\n\tbool \"/dev/hidraw raw HID device support\"\n\thelp\n\tSay Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB\n\tspecification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface\n\tdevices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptible Power Supplies.\n\n\tThis module supports these devices separately using a separate\n\tevent interface on /dev/hidraw.\n\n\tThere is also a /dev/hiddev configuration option in the USB HID\n\tconfiguration menu. In comparison to hiddev, this device does not process\n\tthe hid events at all (no parsing, no lookups). This lets applications\n\tto work on raw hid events when they want to, and avoid using transport-specific\n\tuserspace libhid/libusb libraries.\n\n\tIf unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig UHID\n\ttristate \"User-space I/O driver support for HID subsystem\"\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\tSay Y here if you want to provide HID I/O Drivers from user-space.\n\tThis allows to write I/O drivers in user-space and feed the data from\n\tthe device into the kernel.
