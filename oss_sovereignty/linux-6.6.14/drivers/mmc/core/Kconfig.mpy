By default this option is set to y.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module\n\t  will be called pwrseq_emmc.\n\nconfig PWRSEQ_SD8787\n\ttristate \"HW reset support for SD8787 BT + Wifi module\"\n\tdepends on OF && (MWIFIEX != n || BT_MRVL_SDIO != n || LIBERTAS_SDIO != n || WILC1000_SDIO != n)\n\thelp\n\t  This selects hardware reset support for the SD8787 BT + Wifi\n\t  module. By default this option is set to n.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module\n\t  will be called pwrseq_sd8787.\n\nconfig PWRSEQ_SIMPLE\n\ttristate \"Simple HW reset support for MMC\"\n\tdefault y\n\tdepends on OF\n\thelp\n\t  This selects simple hardware reset support aka pwrseq-simple for MMC\n\t  devices. By default this option is set to y.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module.

Almost everyone wishing MMC support\n\t  should say Y or M here.\n\nconfig MMC_BLOCK_MINORS\n\tint \"Number of minors per block device\"\n\tdepends on MMC_BLOCK\n\trange 4 256\n\tdefault 8\n\thelp\n\t  Number of minors per block device. One is needed for every\n\t  partition on the disk (plus one for the whole disk).\n\n\t  Number of total MMC minors available is 256, so your number\n\t  of supported block devices will be limited to 256 divided\n\t  by this number.\n\n\t  Default is 8 to be backwards compatible with previous\n\t  hardwired device numbering.\n\n\t  If unsure, say 8 here.\n\nconfig SDIO_UART\n\ttristate \"SDIO UART/GPS class support\"\n\tdepends on TTY\n\thelp\n\t  SDIO function driver for SDIO cards that implements the UART\n\t  class, as well as the GPS class which appears like a UART.\n\nconfig MMC_TEST\n\ttristate \"MMC host test driver\"\n\thelp\n\t  Development driver that performs a series of reads and writes\n\t  to a memory card in order to expose certain well known bugs\n\t  in host controllers. The tests are executed by writing to the\n\t  \"test\" file in debugfs under each card. Note that whatever is\n\t  on your card will be overwritten by these tests.\n\n\t  This driver is only of interest to those developing or\n\t  testing a host driver. Most people should say N here.\n\nconfig MMC_CRYPTO\n\tbool \"MMC Crypto Engine Support\"\n\tdepends on BLK_INLINE_ENCRYPTION\n\thelp\n\t  Enable Crypto Engine Support in MMC.\n\t  Enabling this makes it possible for the kernel to use the crypto\n\t  capabilities of the MMC device (if present) to perform crypto\n\t  operations on data being transferred to/from the device.\n",
