This option alone does not add any kernel code.\n\n\t  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.\n\nif ATM_DRIVERS && NETDEVICES && ATM\n\nconfig ATM_DUMMY\n\ttristate \"Dummy ATM driver\"\n\thelp\n\t  Dummy ATM driver. Useful for proxy signalling, testing,\n\t  and development.  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig ATM_TCP\n\ttristate \"ATM over TCP\"\n\tdepends on INET\n\thelp\n\t  ATM over TCP driver. Useful mainly for development and for\n\t  experiments. If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig ATM_LANAI\n\ttristate \"Efficient Networks Speedstream 3010\"\n\tdepends on PCI && ATM\n\thelp\n\t  Supports ATM cards based on the Efficient Networks \"Lanai\"\n\t  chipset such as the Speedstream 3010 and the ENI-25p.  The\n\t  Speedstream 3060 is currently not supported since we don't\n\t  have the code to drive the on-board Alcatel DSL chipset (yet).\n\nconfig ATM_ENI\n\ttristate \"Efficient Networks ENI155P\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\thelp\n\t  Driver for the Efficient Networks ENI155p series and SMC ATM\n\t  Power155 155 Mbps ATM adapters. Both, the versions with 512KB and\n\t  2MB on-board RAM (Efficient calls them \"C\" and \"S\", respectively),\n\t  and the FPGA and the ASIC Tonga versions of the board are supported.\n\t  The driver works with MMF (-MF or ...F) and UTP-5 (-U5 or ...D)\n\t  adapters.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will\n\t  be called eni.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_DEBUG\n\tbool \"Enable extended debugging\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI\n\thelp\n\t  Extended debugging records various events and displays that list\n\t  when an inconsistency is detected. This mechanism is faster than\n\t  generally using printks, but still has some impact on performance.\n\t  Note that extended debugging may create certain race conditions\n\t  itself. Enable this ONLY if you suspect problems with the driver.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\tbool \"Fine-tune burst settings\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI\n\thelp\n\t  In order to obtain good throughput, the ENI NIC can transfer\n\t  multiple words of data per PCI bus access cycle. Such a multi-word\n\t  transfer is called a burst.\n\n\t  The default settings for the burst sizes are suitable for most PCI\n\t  chipsets. However, in some cases, large bursts may overrun buffers\n\t  in the PCI chipset and cause data corruption. In such cases, large\n\t  bursts must be disabled and only (slower) small bursts can be used.\n\t  The burst sizes can be set independently in the send (TX) and\n\t  receive (RX) direction.\n\n\t  Note that enabling many different burst sizes in the same direction\n\t  may increase the cost of setting up a transfer such that the\n\t  resulting throughput is lower than when using only the largest\n\t  available burst size.\n\n\t  Also, sometimes larger bursts lead to lower throughput, e.g. on an\n\t  Intel 440FX board, a drop from 135 Mbps to 103 Mbps was observed\n\t  when going from 8W to 16W bursts.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_BURST_TX_16W\n\tbool \"Enable 16W TX bursts (discouraged)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\thelp\n\t  Burst sixteen words at once in the send direction. This may work\n\t  with recent PCI chipsets, but is known to fail with older chipsets.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_BURST_TX_8W\n\tbool \"Enable 8W TX bursts (recommended)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\thelp\n\t  Burst eight words at once in the send direction. This is the default\n\t  setting.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_BURST_TX_4W\n\tbool \"Enable 4W TX bursts (optional)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\thelp\n\t  Burst four words at once in the send direction. You may want to try\n\t  this if you have disabled 8W bursts. Enabling 4W if 8W is also set\n\t  may or may not improve throughput.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_BURST_TX_2W\n\tbool \"Enable 2W TX bursts (optional)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\thelp\n\t  Burst two words at once in the send direction. You may want to try\n\t  this if you have disabled 4W and 8W bursts. Enabling 2W if 4W or 8W\n\t  are also set may or may not improve throughput.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_16W\n\tbool \"Enable 16W RX bursts (discouraged)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\thelp\n\t  Burst sixteen words at once in the receive direction. This may work\n\t  with recent PCI chipsets, but is known to fail with older chipsets.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_8W\n\tbool \"Enable 8W RX bursts (discouraged)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\thelp\n\t  Burst eight words at once in the receive direction. This may work\n\t  with recent PCI chipsets, but is known to fail with older chipsets,\n\t  such as the Intel Neptune series.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_4W\n\tbool \"Enable 4W RX bursts (recommended)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\thelp\n\t  Burst four words at once in the receive direction. This is the\n\t  default setting. Enabling 4W if 8W is also set may or may not\n\t  improve throughput.\n\nconfig ATM_ENI_BURST_RX_2W\n\tbool \"Enable 2W RX bursts (optional)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_ENI_TUNE_BURST\n\thelp\n\t  Burst two words at once in the receive direction. You may want to\n\t  try this if you have disabled 4W and 8W bursts. Enabling 2W if 4W or\n\t  8W are also set may or may not improve throughput.\n\nconfig ATM_NICSTAR\n\ttristate \"IDT 77201 (NICStAR) (ForeRunnerLE)\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\thelp\n\t  The NICStAR chipset family is used in a large number of ATM NICs for\n\t  25 and for 155 Mbps, including IDT cards and the Fore ForeRunnerLE\n\t  series. Say Y if you have one of those.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will\n\t  be called nicstar.\n\nconfig ATM_NICSTAR_USE_SUNI\n\tbool \"Use suni PHY driver (155Mbps)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_NICSTAR\n\thelp\n\t  Support for the S-UNI and compatible PHYsical layer chips. These are\n\t  found in most 155Mbps NICStAR based ATM cards, namely in the\n\t  ForeRunner LE155 cards. This driver provides detection of cable~\n\t  removal and reinsertion and provides some statistics. This driver\n\t  doesn't have removal capability when compiled as a module, so if you\n\t  need that capability don't include S-UNI support (it's not needed to\n\t  make the card work).\n\nconfig ATM_NICSTAR_USE_IDT77105\n\tbool \"Use IDT77105 PHY driver (25Mbps)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_NICSTAR\n\thelp\n\t  Support for the PHYsical layer chip in ForeRunner LE25 cards. In\n\t  addition to cable removal/reinsertion detection, this driver allows\n\t  you to control the loopback mode of the chip via a dedicated IOCTL.\n\t  This driver is required for proper handling of temporary carrier\n\t  loss, so if you have a 25Mbps NICStAR based ATM card you must say Y.\n\nconfig ATM_IDT77252\n\ttristate \"IDT 77252 (NICStAR II)\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\thelp\n\t  Driver for the IDT 77252 ATM PCI chips.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will\n\t  be called idt77252.\n\nconfig ATM_IDT77252_DEBUG\n\tbool \"Enable debugging messages\"\n\tdepends on ATM_IDT77252\n\thelp\n\t  Somewhat useful debugging messages are available. The choice of\n\t  messages is controlled by a bitmap.  This may be specified as a\n\t  module argument.  See the file <file:drivers/atm/idt77252.h> for\n\t  the meanings of the bits in the mask.\n\n\t  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the\n\t  speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When\n\t  inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.\n\nconfig ATM_IDT77252_RCV_ALL\n\tbool \"Receive ALL cells in raw queue\"\n\tdepends on ATM_IDT77252\n\thelp\n\t  Enable receiving of all cells on the ATM link, that do not match\n\t  an open connection in the raw cell queue of the driver.  Useful\n\t  for debugging or special applications only, so the safe answer is N.\n\nconfig ATM_IDT77252_USE_SUNI\n\tbool\n\tdepends on ATM_IDT77252\n\tdefault y\n\nconfig ATM_IA\n\ttristate \"Interphase ATM PCI x575/x525/x531\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\thelp\n\t  This is a driver for the Interphase (i)ChipSAR adapter cards\n\t  which include a variety of variants in term of the size of the\n\t  control memory (128K-1KVC, 512K-4KVC), the size of the packet\n\t  memory (128K, 512K, 1M), and the PHY type (Single/Multi mode OC3,\n\t  UTP155, UTP25, DS3 and E3). Go to:\n\t  \t<http://www.iphase.com/>\n\t  for more info about the cards. Say Y (or M to compile as a module\n\t  named iphase) here if you have one of these cards.\n\n\t  See the file\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/atm/iphase.rst>\n\t  for further details.\n\nconfig ATM_IA_DEBUG\n\tbool \"Enable debugging messages\"\n\tdepends on ATM_IA\n\thelp\n\t  Somewhat useful debugging messages are available. The choice of\n\t  messages is controlled by a bitmap. This may be specified as a\n\t  module argument (kernel command line argument as well?), changed\n\t  dynamically using an ioctl (Get the debug utility, iadbg, from\n\t  <ftp://ftp.iphase.com/pub/atm/pci/>).\n\n\t  See the file <file:drivers/atm/iphase.h> for the meanings of the\n\t  bits in the mask.\n\n\t  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on the\n\t  speed of the driver, and the size of your syslog files! When\n\t  inactive, they will have only a modest impact on performance.\n\nconfig ATM_FORE200E\n\ttristate \"FORE Systems 200E-series\"\n\tdepends on (PCI || SBUS)\n\tselect FW_LOADER\n\thelp\n\t  This is a driver for the FORE Systems 200E-series ATM adapter\n\t  cards. It simultaneously supports PCA-200E and SBA-200E models\n\t  on PCI and SBUS hosts. Say Y (or M to compile as a module\n\t  named fore_200e) here if you have one of these ATM adapters.\n\n\t  See the file\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/atm/fore200e.rst> for\n\t  further details.\n\nconfig ATM_FORE200E_USE_TASKLET\n\tbool \"Defer interrupt work to a tasklet\"\n\tdepends on ATM_FORE200E\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  This defers work to be done by the interrupt handler to a\n\t  tasklet instead of handling everything at interrupt time.  This\n\t  may improve the responsive of the host.\n\nconfig ATM_FORE200E_TX_RETRY\n\tint \"Maximum number of tx retries\"\n\tdepends on ATM_FORE200E\n\tdefault \"16\"\n\thelp\n\t  Specifies the number of times the driver attempts to transmit\n\t  a message before giving up, if the transmit queue of the ATM card\n\t  is transiently saturated.\n\n\t  Saturation of the transmit queue may occur only under extreme\n\t  conditions, e.g. when a fast host continuously submits very small\n\t  frames (<64 bytes) or raw AAL0 cells (48 bytes) to the ATM adapter.\n\n\t  Note that under common conditions, it is unlikely that you encounter\n\t  a saturation of the transmit queue, so the retry mechanism never\n\t  comes into play.\n\nconfig ATM_FORE200E_DEBUG\n\tint \"Debugging level (0-3)\"\n\tdepends on ATM_FORE200E\n\tdefault \"0\"\n\thelp\n\t  Specifies the level of debugging messages issued by the driver.\n\t  The verbosity of the driver increases with the value of this\n\t  parameter.\n\n\t  When active, these messages can have a significant impact on\n\t  the performances of the driver, and the size of your syslog files!\n\t  Keep the debugging level to 0 during normal operations.\n\nconfig ATM_HE\n\ttristate \"ForeRunner HE Series\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\thelp\n\t  This is a driver for the Marconi ForeRunner HE-series ATM adapter\n\t  cards.
