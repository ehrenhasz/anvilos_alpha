Welsh (matt.welsh@cl.cam.ac.uk)\n *\n * Hacked October, 1997 by Jawaid Bazyar, Interlink Advertising Services Inc.\n * \thttp://www.hypermall.com/\n * 10/1/97 - commented out CFG_PHYIE bit - we don't care when the PHY\n *\tinterrupts us (except possibly for removal/insertion of the cable?)\n * 10/4/97 - began heavy inline documentation of the code. Corrected typos\n *\tand spelling mistakes.\n * 10/5/97 - added code to handle PHY interrupts, disable PHY on\n *\tloss of link, and correctly re-enable PHY when link is\n *\tre-established. (put back CFG_PHYIE)\n *\n *   Modified to work with the IDT7721 nicstar -- AAL5 (tested) only.\n *\n * R. D. Rechenmacher <ron@fnal.gov>, Aug. 6, 1997\n *\n * Linux driver for the IDT77201 NICStAR PCI ATM controller.\n * PHY component is expected to be 155 Mbps S/UNI-Lite or IDT 77155;\n * see init_nicstar() for PHY initialization to change this. This driver\n * expects the Linux ATM stack to support scatter-gather lists \n * (skb->atm.iovcnt != 0) for Rx skb's passed to vcc->push.\n *\n * Implementing minimal-copy of received data:\n *   IDT always receives data into a small buffer, then large buffers\n *     as needed. This means that data must always be copied to create\n *     the linear buffer needed by most non-ATM protocol stacks (e.g. IP)\n *     Fix is simple: make large buffers large enough to hold entire\n *     SDU, and leave <small_buffer_data> bytes empty at the start. Then\n *     copy small buffer contents to head of large buffer.\n *   Trick is to avoid fragmenting Linux, due to need for a lot of large\n *     buffers. This is done by 2 things:\n *       1) skb->destructor / skb->atm.recycle_buffer\n *            combined, allow nicstar_free_rx_skb to be called to\n *            recycle large data buffers\n *       2) skb_clone of received buffers\n *   See nicstar_free_rx_skb and linearize_buffer for implementation\n *     details.\n *\n *\n *\n * Copyright (c) 1996 University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory\n *\n *   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n *   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n *   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n *   (at your option) any later version.\n * \n *   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n *   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n *   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
