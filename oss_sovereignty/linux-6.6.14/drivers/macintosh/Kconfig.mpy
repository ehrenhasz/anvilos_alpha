This option alone does not add any kernel code.\n\n\t  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.\n\nif MACINTOSH_DRIVERS\n\nconfig ADB\n\tbool \"Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) support\"\n\tdepends on MAC || (PPC_PMAC && PPC32)\n\thelp\n\t  Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) support is for support of devices which\n\t  are connected to an ADB port.  ADB devices tend to have 4 pins.\n\t  If you have an Apple Macintosh prior to the iMac, an iBook or\n\t  PowerBook, or a \"Blue and White G3\", you probably want to say Y\n\t  here.  Otherwise say N.\n\nconfig ADB_MACII\n\tbool \"Include Mac II ADB driver\"\n\tdepends on ADB && MAC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if want your kernel to support Macintosh systems that use\n\t  the Mac II style ADB.  This includes the II, IIx, IIcx, SE/30, IIci,\n\t  Quadra 610, Quadra 650, Quadra 700, Quadra 800, Centris 610 and\n\t  Centris 650.\n\nconfig ADB_IOP\n\tbool \"Include IOP (IIfx/Quadra 9x0) ADB driver\"\n\tdepends on ADB && MAC\n\thelp\n\t  The I/O Processor (IOP) is an Apple custom IC designed to provide\n\t  intelligent support for I/O controllers.  It is described at\n\t  <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/dev68k/iopdesc.html> to enable direct\n\t  support for it, say 'Y' here.\n\n# we want to change this to something like CONFIG_SYSCTRL_CUDA/PMU\nconfig ADB_CUDA\n\tbool \"Support for Cuda/Egret based Macs and PowerMacs\"\n\tdepends on (ADB || PPC_PMAC) && !PPC_PMAC64\n\tselect RTC_LIB\n\thelp\n\t  This provides support for Cuda/Egret based Macintosh and\n\t  Power Macintosh systems. This includes most m68k based Macs,\n\t  most Old World PowerMacs, the first generation iMacs, the\n\t  Blue & White G3 and the \"Yikes\" G4 (PCI Graphics). All later\n\t  models should use CONFIG_ADB_PMU instead. It is safe to say Y\n\t  here even if your machine doesn't have a Cuda or Egret device.\n\n\t  If unsure say Y.\n\nconfig ADB_PMU\n\tbool \"Support for PMU based PowerMacs and PowerBooks\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PMAC || MAC\n\tselect RTC_LIB\n\thelp\n\t  On PowerBooks, iBooks, and recent iMacs and Power Macintoshes, the\n\t  PMU is an embedded microprocessor whose primary function is to\n\t  control system power, and battery charging on the portable models.\n\t  The PMU also controls the ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) which connects to\n\t  the keyboard and mouse on some machines, as well as the non-volatile\n\t  RAM and the RTC (real time clock) chip.  Say Y to enable support for\n\t  this device; you should do so if your machine is one of those\n\t  mentioned above.\n\nconfig ADB_PMU_EVENT\n\tdef_bool y\n\tdepends on ADB_PMU && INPUT=y\n\nconfig ADB_PMU_LED\n\tbool \"Support for the Power/iBook front LED\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PMAC && ADB_PMU\n\tselect NEW_LEDS\n\tselect LEDS_CLASS\n\thelp\n\t  Support the front LED on Power/iBooks as a generic LED that can\n\t  be triggered by any of the supported triggers. To get the\n\t  behaviour of the old CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_PMAC_BLINK, select this\n\t  and the disk LED trigger and configure appropriately through sysfs.\n\nconfig ADB_PMU_LED_DISK\n\tbool \"Use front LED as DISK LED by default\"\n\tdepends on ATA\n\tdepends on ADB_PMU_LED\n\tdepends on LEDS_CLASS\n\tselect LEDS_TRIGGERS\n\tselect LEDS_TRIGGER_DISK\n\thelp\n\t  This option makes the front LED default to the disk trigger\n\t  so that it blinks on disk activity.\n\nconfig PMAC_SMU\n\tbool \"Support for SMU  based PowerMacs\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PMAC64\n\thelp\n\t  This option adds support for the newer G5 iMacs and PowerMacs based\n\t  on the \"SMU\" system control chip which replaces the old PMU.\n\t  If you don't know, say Y.\n\nconfig PMAC_APM_EMU\n\ttristate \"APM emulation\"\n\tselect APM_EMULATION\n\tdepends on ADB_PMU && PM && PPC32\n\nconfig PMAC_MEDIABAY\n\tbool \"Support PowerBook hotswap media bay\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PMAC && PPC32 && BLOCK\n\thelp\n\t  This option adds support for older PowerBook's hotswap media bay\n\t  that can contains batteries, floppy drives, or IDE devices. PCI\n\t  devices are not fully supported in the bay as I never had one to\n\t  try with\n\nconfig PMAC_BACKLIGHT\n\tbool \"Backlight control for LCD screens\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PMAC && ADB_PMU && FB = y && (BROKEN || !PPC64)\n\tselect FB_BACKLIGHT\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to enable Macintosh specific extensions of the generic\n\t  backlight code. With this enabled, the brightness keys on older\n\t  PowerBooks will be enabled so you can change the screen brightness.\n\t  Newer models should use a userspace daemon like pbbuttonsd.\n\nconfig PMAC_BACKLIGHT_LEGACY\n\tbool \"Provide legacy ioctl's on /dev/pmu for the backlight\"\n\tdepends on PMAC_BACKLIGHT && (BROKEN || !PPC64)\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y if you want to enable legacy ioctl's on /dev/pmu. This is for\n\t  programs which use this old interface. New and updated programs\n\t  should use the backlight classes in sysfs.\n\nconfig ADB_MACIO\n\tbool \"Include MacIO (CHRP) ADB driver\"\n\tdepends on ADB && PPC_CHRP && !PPC_PMAC64\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to include direct support for the ADB controller in the\n\t  Hydra chip used on PowerPC Macintoshes of the CHRP type.  (The Hydra\n\t  also includes a MESH II SCSI controller, DBDMA controller, VIA chip,\n\t  OpenPIC controller and two RS422/Geoports.)\n\nconfig INPUT_ADBHID\n\tbool \"Support for ADB input devices (keyboard, mice, ...)\"\n\tdepends on ADB && INPUT=y\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to have ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) HID devices\n\t  such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, trackpads  or graphic tablets\n\t  handled by the input layer.  If you say Y here, make sure to say Y to\n\t  the corresponding drivers \"Mouse Support\" (CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV) and\n\t  \"Event interface support\" (CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV) as well.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig MAC_EMUMOUSEBTN\n\ttristate \"Support for mouse button 2+3 emulation\"\n\tdepends on SYSCTL && INPUT\n\thelp\n\t  This provides generic support for emulating the 2nd and 3rd mouse\n\t  button with keypresses.  If you say Y here, the emulation is still\n\t  disabled by default.  The emulation is controlled by these sysctl\n\t  entries:\n\t  /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button_emulation\n\t  /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button2_keycode\n\t  /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button3_keycode\n\n\t  If you have an Apple machine with a 1-button mouse, say Y here.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called mac_hid.\n\nconfig THERM_WINDTUNNEL\n\ttristate \"Support for thermal management on Windtunnel G4s\"\n\tdepends on I2C && I2C_POWERMAC && PPC_PMAC && !PPC_PMAC64\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides some thermostat and fan control for the desktop\n\t  G4 \"Windtunnel\"\n\nconfig THERM_ADT746X\n\ttristate \"Support for thermal mgmnt on laptops with ADT 746x chipset\"\n\tdepends on I2C && I2C_POWERMAC && PPC_PMAC && !PPC_PMAC64\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides some thermostat and fan control for the\n\t  iBook G4, and the ATI based aluminium PowerBooks, allowing slightly\n\t  better fan behaviour by default, and some manual control.\n\nconfig WINDFARM\n\ttristate \"New PowerMac thermal control infrastructure\"\n\tdepends on PPC\n\nconfig WINDFARM_PM81\n\ttristate \"Support for thermal management on iMac G5\"\n\tdepends on WINDFARM && I2C && CPU_FREQ_PMAC64 && PMAC_SMU\n\tselect I2C_POWERMAC\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides thermal control for the iMacG5\n\nconfig WINDFARM_PM72\n\ttristate \"Support for thermal management on PowerMac G5 (AGP)\"\n\tdepends on WINDFARM && I2C && CPU_FREQ_PMAC64 && ADB_PMU\n\tselect I2C_POWERMAC\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides thermal control for the PowerMac G5\n\t  \"AGP\" variants (PowerMac 7,2 and 7,3)\n\nconfig WINDFARM_RM31\n\ttristate \"Support for thermal management on Xserve G5\"\n\tdepends on WINDFARM && I2C && CPU_FREQ_PMAC64 && ADB_PMU\n\tselect I2C_POWERMAC\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides thermal control for the Xserve G5\n\t  (RackMac3,1)\n\nconfig WINDFARM_PM91\n\ttristate \"Support for thermal management on PowerMac9,1\"\n\tdepends on WINDFARM && I2C && CPU_FREQ_PMAC64 && PMAC_SMU\n\tselect I2C_POWERMAC\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides thermal control for the PowerMac9,1\n\t  which is the recent (SMU based) single CPU desktop G5\n\nconfig WINDFARM_PM112\n\ttristate \"Support for thermal management on PowerMac11,2\"\n\tdepends on WINDFARM && I2C && PMAC_SMU\n\tselect I2C_POWERMAC\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides thermal control for the PowerMac11,2\n\t  which are the recent dual and quad G5 machines using the\n\t  970MP dual-core processor.\n\nconfig WINDFARM_PM121\n\ttristate \"Support for thermal management on PowerMac12,1\"\n\tdepends on WINDFARM && I2C && PMAC_SMU\n\tselect I2C_POWERMAC\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides thermal control for the PowerMac12,1\n\t  which is the iMac G5 (iSight).\n\nconfig ANSLCD\n\ttristate \"Support for ANS LCD display\"\n\tdepends on ADB_CUDA && PPC_PMAC\n\nconfig PMAC_RACKMETER\n\ttristate \"Support for Apple XServe front panel LEDs\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PMAC\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides some support to control the front panel\n\t  blue LEDs \"vu-meter\" of the XServer macs.\n\nconfig SENSORS_AMS\n\ttristate \"Apple Motion Sensor driver\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PMAC && !PPC64 && INPUT && ((ADB_PMU && I2C = y) || (ADB_PMU && !I2C) || I2C)\n\thelp\n\t  Support for the motion sensor included in PowerBooks.
