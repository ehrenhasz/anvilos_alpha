(For details see\n\t  <https://www.capi.org/>.)  CAPI supports making and accepting voice\n\t  and data connections, controlling call options and protocols,\n\t  as well as ISDN supplementary services like call forwarding or\n\t  three-party conferences (if supported by the specific hardware\n\t  driver).\n\n\t  This subsystem requires a hardware specific driver.\n\t  See CONFIG_BT_CMTP for the last remaining regular driver\n\t  in the kernel that uses the CAPI subsystem.\n\nconfig CAPI_TRACE\n\tdef_bool BT_CMTP\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, the kernelcapi driver can make verbose traces\n\t  of CAPI messages. This feature can be enabled/disabled via IOCTL for\n\t  every controller (default disabled).\n\nconfig ISDN_CAPI_MIDDLEWARE\n\tdef_bool BT_CMTP && TTY\n\thelp\n\t  This option will enhance the capabilities of the /dev/capi20\n\t  interface.  It will provide a means of moving a data connection,\n\t  established via the usual /dev/capi20 interface to a special tty\n\t  device.  If you want to use pppd with pppdcapiplugin to dial up to\n\t  your ISP, say Y here.\n",
