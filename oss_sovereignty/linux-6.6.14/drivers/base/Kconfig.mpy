It\n\t  usually pointed to a shell script at /sbin/hotplug.\n\t  This should not be used today, because usual systems create\n\t  many events at bootup or device discovery in a very short time\n\t  frame. One forked process per event can create so many processes\n\t  that it creates a high system load, or on smaller systems\n\t  it is known to create out-of-memory situations during bootup.\n\nconfig UEVENT_HELPER_PATH\n\tstring \"path to uevent helper\"\n\tdepends on UEVENT_HELPER\n\tdefault \"\"\n\thelp\n\t  To disable user space helper program execution at by default\n\t  specify an empty string here. This setting can still be altered\n\t  via /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug or via /sys/kernel/uevent_helper\n\t  later at runtime.\n\nconfig DEVTMPFS\n\tbool \"Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev\"\n\thelp\n\t  This creates a tmpfs/ramfs filesystem instance early at bootup.\n\t  In this filesystem, the kernel driver core maintains device\n\t  nodes with their default names and permissions for all\n\t  registered devices with an assigned major/minor number.\n\t  Userspace can modify the filesystem content as needed, add\n\t  symlinks, and apply needed permissions.\n\t  It provides a fully functional /dev directory, where usually\n\t  udev runs on top, managing permissions and adding meaningful\n\t  symlinks.\n\t  In very limited environments, it may provide a sufficient\n\t  functional /dev without any further help. It also allows simple\n\t  rescue systems, and reliably handles dynamic major/minor numbers.\n\n\t  Notice: if CONFIG_TMPFS isn't enabled, the simpler ramfs\n\t  file system will be used instead.\n\nconfig DEVTMPFS_MOUNT\n\tbool \"Automount devtmpfs at /dev, after the kernel mounted the rootfs\"\n\tdepends on DEVTMPFS\n\thelp\n\t  This will instruct the kernel to automatically mount the\n\t  devtmpfs filesystem at /dev, directly after the kernel has\n\t  mounted the root filesystem. The behavior can be overridden\n\t  with the commandline parameter: devtmpfs.mount=0|1.\n\t  This option does not affect initramfs based booting, here\n\t  the devtmpfs filesystem always needs to be mounted manually\n\t  after the rootfs is mounted.\n\t  With this option enabled, it allows to bring up a system in\n\t  rescue mode with init=/bin/sh, even when the /dev directory\n\t  on the rootfs is completely empty.\n\nconfig DEVTMPFS_SAFE\n\tbool \"Use nosuid,noexec mount options on devtmpfs\"\n\tdepends on DEVTMPFS\n\thelp\n\t  This instructs the kernel to include the MS_NOEXEC and MS_NOSUID mount\n\t  flags when mounting devtmpfs.\n\n\t  Notice: If enabled, things like /dev/mem cannot be mmapped\n\t  with the PROT_EXEC flag. This can break, for example, non-KMS\n\t  video drivers.\n\nconfig STANDALONE\n\tbool \"Select only drivers that don't need compile-time external firmware\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Select this option if you don't have magic firmware for drivers that\n\t  need it.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD\n\tbool \"Disable drivers features which enable custom firmware building\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Say yes to disable driver features which enable building a custom\n\t  driver firmware at kernel build time. These drivers do not use the\n\t  kernel firmware API to load firmware (CONFIG_FW_LOADER), instead they\n\t  use their own custom loading mechanism. The required firmware is\n\t  usually shipped with the driver, building the driver firmware\n\t  should only be needed if you have an updated firmware source.\n\n\t  Firmware should not be being built as part of kernel, these days\n\t  you should always prevent this and say Y here. There are only two\n\t  old drivers which enable building of its firmware at kernel build\n\t  time:\n\n\t    o CONFIG_WANXL through CONFIG_WANXL_BUILD_FIRMWARE\n\t    o CONFIG_SCSI_AIC79XX through CONFIG_AIC79XX_BUILD_FIRMWARE\n\nsource \"drivers/base/firmware_loader/Kconfig\"\n\nconfig WANT_DEV_COREDUMP\n\tbool\n\thelp\n\t  Drivers should \"select\" this option if they desire to use the\n\t  device coredump mechanism.\n\nconfig ALLOW_DEV_COREDUMP\n\tbool \"Allow device coredump\" if EXPERT\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  This option controls if the device coredump mechanism is available or\n\t  not; if disabled, the mechanism will be omitted even if drivers that\n\t  can use it are enabled.\n\t  Say 'N' for more sensitive systems or systems that don't want\n\t  to ever access the information to not have the code, nor keep any\n\t  data.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig DEV_COREDUMP\n\tbool\n\tdefault y if WANT_DEV_COREDUMP\n\tdepends on ALLOW_DEV_COREDUMP\n\nconfig DEBUG_DRIVER\n\tbool \"Driver Core verbose debug messages\"\n\tdepends on DEBUG_KERNEL\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want the Driver core to produce a bunch of\n\t  debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a\n\t  problem with the driver core and want to see more of what is\n\t  going on.\n\n\t  If you are unsure about this, say N here.\n\nconfig DEBUG_DEVRES\n\tbool \"Managed device resources verbose debug messages\"\n\tdepends on DEBUG_KERNEL\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables kernel parameter devres.log. If set to\n\t  non-zero, devres debug messages are printed. Select this if\n\t  you are having a problem with devres or want to debug\n\t  resource management for a managed device. devres.log can be\n\t  switched on and off from sysfs node.\n\n\t  If you are unsure about this, Say N here.\n\nconfig DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE\n\tbool \"Test driver remove calls during probe (UNSTABLE)\"\n\tdepends on DEBUG_KERNEL\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want the Driver core to test driver remove functions\n\t  by calling probe, remove, probe. This tests the remove path without\n\t  having to unbind the driver or unload the driver module.\n\n\t  This option is expected to find errors and may render your system\n\t  unusable. You should say N here unless you are explicitly looking to\n\t  test this functionality.\n\nconfig PM_QOS_KUNIT_TEST\n\tbool \"KUnit Test for PM QoS features\" if !KUNIT_ALL_TESTS\n\tdepends on KUNIT=y\n\tdefault KUNIT_ALL_TESTS\n\nconfig HMEM_REPORTING\n\tbool\n\tdefault n\n\tdepends on NUMA\n\thelp\n\t  Enable reporting for heterogeneous memory access attributes under\n\t  their non-uniform memory nodes.\n\nsource \"drivers/base/test/Kconfig\"\n\nconfig SYS_HYPERVISOR\n\tbool\n\tdefault n\n\nconfig GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES\n\tbool\n\tdefault n\n\nconfig GENERIC_CPU_AUTOPROBE\n\tbool\n\nconfig GENERIC_CPU_VULNERABILITIES\n\tbool\n\nconfig SOC_BUS\n\tbool\n\tselect GLOB\n\nsource \"drivers/base/regmap/Kconfig\"\n\nconfig DMA_SHARED_BUFFER\n\tbool\n\tdefault n\n\tselect IRQ_WORK\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables the framework for buffer-sharing between\n\t  multiple drivers. A buffer is associated with a file using driver\n\t  APIs extension; the file's descriptor can then be passed on to other\n\t  driver.\n\nconfig DMA_FENCE_TRACE\n\tbool \"Enable verbose DMA_FENCE_TRACE messages\"\n\tdepends on DMA_SHARED_BUFFER\n\thelp\n\t  Enable the DMA_FENCE_TRACE printks. This will add extra\n\t  spam to the console log, but will make it easier to diagnose\n\t  lockup related problems for dma-buffers shared across multiple\n\t  devices.\n\nconfig GENERIC_ARCH_TOPOLOGY\n\tbool\n\thelp\n\t  Enable support for architectures common topology code: e.g., parsing\n\t  CPU capacity information from DT, usage of such information for\n\t  appropriate scaling, sysfs interface for reading capacity values at\n\t  runtime.\n\nconfig GENERIC_ARCH_NUMA\n\tbool\n\thelp\n\t  Enable support for generic NUMA implementation. Currently, RISC-V\n\t  and ARM64 use it.\n\nconfig FW_DEVLINK_SYNC_STATE_TIMEOUT\n\tbool \"sync_state() behavior defaults to timeout instead of strict\"\n\thelp\n\t  This is build time equivalent of adding kernel command line parameter\n\t  \"fw_devlink.sync_state=timeout\". Give up waiting on consumers and\n\t  call sync_state() on any devices that haven't yet received their\n\t  sync_state() calls after deferred_probe_timeout has expired or by\n\t  late_initcall() if !CONFIG_MODULES. You should almost always want to\n\t  select N here unless you have already successfully tested with the\n\t  command line option on every system/board your kernel is expected to\n\t  work on.\n\nendmenu\n",
