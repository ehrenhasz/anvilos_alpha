Devfreq can\n\t  reevaluate the device state periodically and/or based on the\n\t  notification to \"nb\", a notifier block, of devfreq.\n\n\t  Like some CPUs with CPUfreq, a device may have multiple clocks.\n\t  However, because the clock frequencies of a single device are\n\t  determined by the single device's state, an instance of devfreq\n\t  is attached to a single device and returns a \"representative\"\n\t  clock frequency of the device, which is also attached\n\t  to a device by 1-to-1. The device registering devfreq takes the\n\t  responsibility to \"interpret\" the representative frequency and\n\t  to set its every clock accordingly with the \"target\" callback\n\t  given to devfreq.\n\n\t  When OPP is used with the devfreq device, it is recommended to\n\t  register devfreq's nb to the OPP's notifier head.  If OPP is\n\t  used with the devfreq device, you may use OPP helper\n\t  functions defined in devfreq.h.\n\nif PM_DEVFREQ\n\ncomment \"DEVFREQ Governors\"\n\nconfig DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND\n\ttristate \"Simple Ondemand\"\n\thelp\n\t  Chooses frequency based on the recent load on the device. Works\n\t  similar as ONDEMAND governor of CPUFREQ does. A device with\n\t  Simple-Ondemand should be able to provide busy/total counter\n\t  values that imply the usage rate. A device may provide tuned\n\t  values to the governor with data field at devfreq_add_device().\n\nconfig DEVFREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE\n\ttristate \"Performance\"\n\thelp\n\t  Sets the frequency at the maximum available frequency.\n\t  This governor always returns UINT_MAX as frequency so that\n\t  the DEVFREQ framework returns the highest frequency available\n\t  at any time.\n\nconfig DEVFREQ_GOV_POWERSAVE\n\ttristate \"Powersave\"\n\thelp\n\t  Sets the frequency at the minimum available frequency.\n\t  This governor always returns 0 as frequency so that\n\t  the DEVFREQ framework returns the lowest frequency available\n\t  at any time.\n\nconfig DEVFREQ_GOV_USERSPACE\n\ttristate \"Userspace\"\n\thelp\n\t  Sets the frequency at the user specified one.\n\t  This governor returns the user configured frequency if there\n\t  has been an input to /sys/devices/.../userspace/set_freq.\n\t  Otherwise, the governor does not change the frequency\n\t  given at the initialization.\n\nconfig DEVFREQ_GOV_PASSIVE\n\ttristate \"Passive\"\n\thelp\n\t  Sets the frequency based on the frequency of its parent devfreq\n\t  device. This governor does not change the frequency by itself\n\t  through sysfs entries. The passive governor recommends that\n\t  devfreq device uses the OPP table to get the frequency/voltage.\n\ncomment \"DEVFREQ Drivers\"\n\nconfig ARM_EXYNOS_BUS_DEVFREQ\n\ttristate \"ARM Exynos Generic Memory Bus DEVFREQ Driver\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_EXYNOS || COMPILE_TEST\n\tselect DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND\n\tselect DEVFREQ_GOV_PASSIVE\n\tselect DEVFREQ_EVENT_EXYNOS_PPMU\n\tselect PM_DEVFREQ_EVENT\n\thelp\n\t  This adds the common DEVFREQ driver for Exynos Memory bus. Exynos\n\t  Memory bus has one more group of memory bus (e.g, MIF and INT block).\n\t  Each memory bus group could contain many memoby bus block. It reads\n\t  PPMU counters of memory controllers by using DEVFREQ-event device\n\t  and adjusts the operating frequencies and voltages with OPP support.\n\t  This does not yet operate with optimal voltages.\n\nconfig ARM_IMX_BUS_DEVFREQ\n\ttristate \"i.MX Generic Bus DEVFREQ Driver\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_MXC || COMPILE_TEST\n\tselect DEVFREQ_GOV_USERSPACE\n\thelp\n\t  This adds the generic DEVFREQ driver for i.MX interconnects.

It can track\n\t  buck voltages and update a proper CCI frequency. Use the notification\n\t  to get the regulator status.\n\nconfig ARM_RK3399_DMC_DEVFREQ\n\ttristate \"ARM RK3399 DMC DEVFREQ Driver\"\n\tdepends on (ARCH_ROCKCHIP && HAVE_ARM_SMCCC) || \\\n\t\t(COMPILE_TEST && HAVE_ARM_SMCCC)\n\tselect DEVFREQ_EVENT_ROCKCHIP_DFI\n\tselect DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND\n\tselect PM_DEVFREQ_EVENT\n\thelp\n\t  This adds the DEVFREQ driver for the RK3399 DMC(Dynamic Memory Controller).\n\t  It sets the frequency for the memory controller and reads the usage counts\n\t  from hardware.\n\nconfig ARM_SUN8I_A33_MBUS_DEVFREQ\n\ttristate \"sun8i/sun50i MBUS DEVFREQ Driver\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_SUNXI || COMPILE_TEST\n\tdepends on COMMON_CLK\n\tselect DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND\n\thelp\n\t  This adds the DEVFREQ driver for the MBUS controller in some\n\t  Allwinner sun8i (A33 through H3) and sun50i (A64 and H5) SoCs.\n\nsource \"drivers/devfreq/event/Kconfig\"\n\nendif # PM_DEVFREQ\n",
