This driver does that and creates subpartitions for\n\t  each found environment variables block.\n\nconfig MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS\n\ttristate \"Command line partition table parsing\"\n\tdepends on MTD\n\thelp\n\t  Allow generic configuration of the MTD partition tables via the kernel\n\t  command line. Multiple flash resources are supported for hardware where\n\t  different kinds of flash memory are available.\n\n\t  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver\n\t  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The\n\t  SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for\n\t  example.\n\n\t  The format for the command line is as follows:\n\n\t  mtdparts=<mtddef>[;<mtddef]\n\t  <mtddef>  := <mtd-id>:<partdef>[,<partdef>]\n\t  <partdef> := <size>[@offset][<name>][ro]\n\t  <mtd-id>  := unique id used in mapping driver/device\n\t  <size>    := standard linux memsize OR \"-\" to denote all\n\t  remaining space\n\t  <name>    := (NAME)\n\n\t  Due to the way Linux handles the command line, no spaces are\n\t  allowed in the partition definition, including mtd id's and partition\n\t  names.\n\n\t  Examples:\n\n\t  1 flash resource (mtd-id \"sa1100\"), with 1 single writable partition:\n\t  mtdparts=sa1100:-\n\n\t  Same flash, but 2 named partitions, the first one being read-only:\n\t  mtdparts=sa1100:256k(ARMboot)ro,-(root)\n\n\t  If unsure, say 'N'.\n\nconfig MTD_OF_PARTS\n\ttristate \"OpenFirmware (device tree) partitioning parser\"\n\tdefault y\n\tdepends on OF\n\thelp\n\t  This provides a open firmware device tree partition parser\n\t  which derives the partition map from the children of the\n\t  flash memory node, as described in\n\t  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/mtd.yaml.\n\nconfig MTD_OF_PARTS_BCM4908\n\tbool \"BCM4908 partitioning support\"\n\tdepends on MTD_OF_PARTS && (ARCH_BCMBCA || COMPILE_TEST)\n\tdefault ARCH_BCMBCA\n\thelp\n\t  This provides partitions parser for BCM4908 family devices\n\t  that can have multiple \"firmware\" partitions. It takes care of\n\t  finding currently used one and backup ones.\n\nconfig MTD_OF_PARTS_LINKSYS_NS\n\tbool \"Linksys Northstar partitioning support\"\n\tdepends on MTD_OF_PARTS && (ARCH_BCM_5301X || ARCH_BCMBCA || COMPILE_TEST)\n\tdefault ARCH_BCM_5301X\n\thelp\n\t  This provides partitions parser for Linksys devices based on Broadcom\n\t  Northstar architecture. Linksys commonly uses fixed flash layout with\n\t  two \"firmware\" partitions. Currently used firmware has to be detected\n\t  using CFE environment variable.\n\nconfig MTD_PARSER_IMAGETAG\n\ttristate \"Parser for BCM963XX Image Tag format partitions\"\n\tdepends on BCM63XX || BMIPS_GENERIC || COMPILE_TEST\n\tselect CRC32\n\thelp\n\t  Image Tag is the firmware header used by broadcom on their xDSL line\n\t  of devices. It is used to describe the offsets and lengths of kernel\n\t  and rootfs partitions.\n\t  This driver adds support for parsing a partition with an Image Tag\n\t  header and creates up to two partitions, kernel and rootfs.\n\nconfig MTD_AFS_PARTS\n\ttristate \"ARM Firmware Suite partition parsing\"\n\tdepends on (ARM || ARM64)\n\thelp\n\t  The ARM Firmware Suite allows the user to divide flash devices into\n\t  multiple 'images'. Each such image has a header containing its name\n\t  and offset/size etc.\n\n\t  If you need code which can detect and parse these tables, and\n\t  register MTD 'partitions' corresponding to each image detected,\n\t  enable this option.\n\n\t  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver\n\t  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The\n\t  'physmap' map driver (CONFIG_MTD_PHYSMAP) does this, for example.\n\nconfig MTD_PARSER_TPLINK_SAFELOADER\n\ttristate \"TP-Link Safeloader partitions parser\"\n\tdepends on MTD && (ARCH_BCM_5301X || ATH79 || SOC_MT7620 || SOC_MT7621 || COMPILE_TEST)\n\thelp\n\t  TP-Link home routers use flash partitions to store various data. Info\n\t  about flash space layout is stored in a partitions table using a\n\t  custom ASCII-based format.\n\n\t  That format was first found in devices with SafeLoader bootloader and\n\t  was named after it. Later it was adapted to CFE and U-Boot\n\t  bootloaders.\n\n\t  This driver reads partitions table, parses it and creates MTD\n\t  partitions.\n\nconfig MTD_PARSER_TRX\n\ttristate \"Parser for TRX format partitions\"\n\tdepends on MTD && (BCM47XX || ARCH_BCM_5301X || ARCH_MEDIATEK || RALINK || COMPILE_TEST)\n\thelp\n\t  TRX is a firmware format used by Broadcom on their devices. It\n\t  may contain up to 3/4 partitions (depending on the version).\n\t  This driver will parse TRX header and report at least two partitions:\n\t  kernel and rootfs.\n\nconfig MTD_SHARPSL_PARTS\n\ttristate \"Sharp SL Series NAND flash partition parser\"\n\tdepends on MTD_NAND_SHARPSL || COMPILE_TEST\n\thelp\n\t  This provides the read-only FTL logic necessary to read the partition\n\t  table from the NAND flash of Sharp SL Series (Zaurus) and the MTD\n\t  partition parser using this code.\n\nconfig MTD_REDBOOT_PARTS\n\ttristate \"RedBoot partition table parsing\"\n\thelp\n\t  RedBoot is a ROM monitor and bootloader which deals with multiple\n\t  'images' in flash devices by putting a table one of the erase\n\t  blocks on the device, similar to a partition table, which gives\n\t  the offsets, lengths and names of all the images stored in the\n\t  flash.\n\n\t  If you need code which can detect and parse this table, and register\n\t  MTD 'partitions' corresponding to each image in the table, enable\n\t  this option.\n\n\t  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver\n\t  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The\n\t  SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for\n\t  example.\n\nif MTD_REDBOOT_PARTS\n\nconfig MTD_REDBOOT_DIRECTORY_BLOCK\n\tint \"Location of RedBoot partition table\"\n\tdefault \"-1\"\n\thelp\n\t  This option is the Linux counterpart to the\n\t  CYGNUM_REDBOOT_FIS_DIRECTORY_BLOCK RedBoot compile time\n\t  option.\n\n\t  The option specifies which Flash sectors holds the RedBoot\n\t  partition table.  A zero or positive value gives an absolute\n\t  erase block number. A negative value specifies a number of\n\t  sectors before the end of the device.\n\n\t  For example \"2\" means block number 2, \"-1\" means the last\n\t  block and \"-2\" means the penultimate block.\n\nconfig MTD_REDBOOT_PARTS_UNALLOCATED\n\tbool \"Include unallocated flash regions\"\n\thelp\n\t  If you need to register each unallocated flash region as a MTD\n\t  'partition', enable this option.\n\nconfig MTD_REDBOOT_PARTS_READONLY\n\tbool \"Force read-only for RedBoot system images\"\n\thelp\n\t  If you need to force read-only for 'RedBoot', 'RedBoot Config' and\n\t  'FIS directory' images, enable this option.\n\nendif # MTD_REDBOOT_PARTS\n\nconfig MTD_QCOMSMEM_PARTS\n\ttristate \"Qualcomm SMEM flash partition parser\"\n\tdepends on QCOM_SMEM\n\thelp\n\t  This provides support for parsing partitions from Shared Memory (SMEM)\n\t  for NAND and SPI flash on Qualcomm platforms.\n\nconfig MTD_SERCOMM_PARTS\n\ttristate \"Sercomm partition table parser\"\n\tdepends on MTD && RALINK\n\thelp\n\t  This provides partitions table parser for devices with Sercomm\n\t  partition map. This partition table contains real partition\n\t  offsets, which may differ from device to device depending on the\n\t  number and location of bad blocks on NAND.\n",
