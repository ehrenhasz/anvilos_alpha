Depending\n\t  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison\n\t  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).\n\t  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with\n\t  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using\n\t  64 KiB block instead of 16 \u00d7 4 KiB sectors.\n\n\t  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with\n\t  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).\n\nchoice\n\tprompt \"Software write protection at boot\"\n\tdefault MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_DISABLE_ON_VOLATILE\n\nconfig MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_DISABLE\n\tbool \"Disable SWP on any flashes (legacy behavior)\"\n\thelp\n\t  This option disables the software write protection on any SPI\n\t  flashes at boot-up.\n\n\t  Depending on the flash chip this either clears the block protection\n\t  bits or does a \"Global Unprotect\" command.\n\n\t  Don't use this if you intent to use the software write protection\n\t  of your SPI flash. This is only to keep backwards compatibility.\n\nconfig MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_DISABLE_ON_VOLATILE\n\tbool \"Disable SWP on flashes w/ volatile protection bits\"\n\thelp\n\t  Some SPI flashes have volatile block protection bits, ie. after a\n\t  power-up or a reset the flash is software write protected by\n\t  default.\n\n\t  This option disables the software write protection for these kind\n\t  of flashes while keeping it enabled for any other SPI flashes\n\t  which have non-volatile write protection bits.\n\n\t  If the software write protection will be disabled depending on\n\t  the flash either the block protection bits are cleared or a\n\t  \"Global Unprotect\" command is issued.\n\n\t  If you are unsure, select this option.\n\nconfig MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_KEEP\n\tbool \"Keep software write protection as is\"\n\thelp\n\t  If you select this option the software write protection of any\n\t  SPI flashes will not be changed.
