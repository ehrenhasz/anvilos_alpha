The CXL.cache protocol allows devices to hold cachelines\n\t  locally, the CXL.mem protocol allows devices to be fully coherent\n\t  memory targets, the CXL.io protocol is equivalent to PCI Express.\n\t  Say 'y' to enable support for the configuration and management of\n\t  devices supporting these protocols.\n\nif CXL_BUS\n\nconfig CXL_PCI\n\ttristate \"PCI manageability\"\n\tdefault CXL_BUS\n\thelp\n\t  The CXL specification defines a \"CXL memory device\" sub-class in the\n\t  PCI \"memory controller\" base class of devices. Device's identified by\n\t  this class code provide support for volatile and / or persistent\n\t  memory to be mapped into the system address map (Host-managed Device\n\t  Memory (HDM)).\n\n\t  Say 'y/m' to enable a driver that will attach to CXL memory expander\n\t  devices enumerated by the memory device class code for configuration\n\t  and management primarily via the mailbox interface. See Chapter 2.3\n\t  Type 3 CXL Device in the CXL 2.0 specification for more details.\n\n\t  If unsure say 'm'.\n\nconfig CXL_MEM_RAW_COMMANDS\n\tbool \"RAW Command Interface for Memory Devices\"\n\tdepends on CXL_PCI\n\thelp\n\t  Enable CXL RAW command interface.\n\n\t  The CXL driver ioctl interface may assign a kernel ioctl command\n\t  number for each specification defined opcode. At any given point in\n\t  time the number of opcodes that the specification defines and a device\n\t  may implement may exceed the kernel's set of associated ioctl function\n\t  numbers. The mismatch is either by omission, specification is too new,\n\t  or by design. When prototyping new hardware, or developing / debugging\n\t  the driver it is useful to be able to submit any possible command to\n\t  the hardware, even commands that may crash the kernel due to their\n\t  potential impact to memory currently in use by the kernel.\n\n\t  If developing CXL hardware or the driver say Y, otherwise say N.\n\nconfig CXL_ACPI\n\ttristate \"CXL ACPI: Platform Support\"\n\tdepends on ACPI\n\tdefault CXL_BUS\n\tselect ACPI_TABLE_LIB\n\thelp\n\t  Enable support for host managed device memory (HDM) resources\n\t  published by a platform's ACPI CXL memory layout description.  See\n\t  Chapter 9.14.1 CXL Early Discovery Table (CEDT) in the CXL 2.0\n\t  specification, and CXL Fixed Memory Window Structures (CEDT.CFMWS)\n\t  (https://www.computeexpresslink.org/spec-landing). The CXL core\n\t  consumes these resource to publish the root of a cxl_port decode\n\t  hierarchy to map regions that represent System RAM, or Persistent\n\t  Memory regions to be managed by LIBNVDIMM.\n\n\t  If unsure say 'm'.\n\nconfig CXL_PMEM\n\ttristate \"CXL PMEM: Persistent Memory Support\"\n\tdepends on LIBNVDIMM\n\tdefault CXL_BUS\n\thelp\n\t  In addition to typical memory resources a platform may also advertise\n\t  support for persistent memory attached via CXL. This support is\n\t  managed via a bridge driver from CXL to the LIBNVDIMM system\n\t  subsystem. Say 'y/m' to enable support for enumerating and\n\t  provisioning the persistent memory capacity of CXL memory expanders.\n\n\t  If unsure say 'm'.\n\nconfig CXL_MEM\n\ttristate \"CXL: Memory Expansion\"\n\tdepends on CXL_PCI\n\tdefault CXL_BUS\n\thelp\n\t  The CXL.mem protocol allows a device to act as a provider of \"System\n\t  RAM\" and/or \"Persistent Memory\" that is fully coherent as if the\n\t  memory were attached to the typical CPU memory controller. This is\n\t  known as HDM \"Host-managed Device Memory\".\n\n\t  Say 'y/m' to enable a driver that will attach to CXL.mem devices for\n\t  memory expansion and control of HDM. See Chapter 9.13 in the CXL 2.0\n\t  specification for a detailed description of HDM.\n\n\t  If unsure say 'm'.\n\nconfig CXL_PORT\n\tdefault CXL_BUS\n\ttristate\n\nconfig CXL_SUSPEND\n\tdef_bool y\n\tdepends on SUSPEND && CXL_MEM\n\nconfig CXL_REGION\n\tbool \"CXL: Region Support\"\n\tdefault CXL_BUS\n\t# For MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS\n\tdepends on SPARSEMEM\n\tselect MEMREGION\n\tselect GET_FREE_REGION\n\thelp\n\t  Enable the CXL core to enumerate and provision CXL regions. A CXL\n\t  region is defined by one or more CXL expanders that decode a given\n\t  system-physical address range. For CXL regions established by\n\t  platform-firmware this option enables memory error handling to\n\t  identify the devices participating in a given interleaved memory\n\t  range. Otherwise, platform-firmware managed CXL is enabled by being\n\t  placed in the system address map and does not need a driver.\n\n\t  If unsure say 'y'\n\nconfig CXL_REGION_INVALIDATION_TEST\n\tbool \"CXL: Region Cache Management Bypass (TEST)\"\n\tdepends on CXL_REGION\n\thelp\n\t  CXL Region management and security operations potentially invalidate\n\t  the content of CPU caches without notifying those caches to\n\t  invalidate the affected cachelines. The CXL Region driver attempts\n\t  to invalidate caches when those events occur.  If that invalidation\n\t  fails the region will fail to enable.  Reasons for cache\n\t  invalidation failure are due to the CPU not providing a cache\n\t  invalidation mechanism. For example usage of wbinvd is restricted to\n\t  bare metal x86. However, for testing purposes toggling this option\n\t  can disable that data integrity safety and proceed with enabling\n\t  regions when there might be conflicting contents in the CPU cache.\n\n\t  If unsure, or if this kernel is meant for production environments,\n\t  say N.\n\nconfig CXL_PMU\n\ttristate \"CXL Performance Monitoring Unit\"\n\tdefault CXL_BUS\n\tdepends on PERF_EVENTS\n\thelp\n\t  Support performance monitoring as defined in CXL rev 3.0\n\t  section 13.2: Performance Monitoring. CXL components may have\n\t  one or more CXL Performance Monitoring Units (CPMUs).\n\n\t  Say 'y/m' to enable a driver that will attach to performance\n\t  monitoring units and provide standard perf based interfaces.\n\n\t  If unsure say 'm'.\nendif\n",
