The\n\t  standard defines a Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which can\n\t  be used to achieve synchronization within a few dozen\n\t  microseconds. In addition, with the help of special hardware\n\t  time stamping units, it can be possible to achieve\n\t  synchronization to within a few hundred nanoseconds.\n\n\t  This driver adds support for PTP clocks as character\n\t  devices.
