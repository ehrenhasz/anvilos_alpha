Juju, a new implementation designed for robustness and\n\t  simplicity.\n\t  See http://ieee1394.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Juju_Migration\n\t  for information about migration from the older Linux 1394 stack\n\t  to the new driver stack.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the module will be\n\t  called firewire-core.\n\nconfig FIREWIRE_KUNIT_UAPI_TEST\n\ttristate \"KUnit tests for layout of structure in UAPI\" if !KUNIT_ALL_TESTS\n\tdepends on FIREWIRE && KUNIT\n\tdefault KUNIT_ALL_TESTS\n\thelp\n\t  This builds the KUnit tests whether structures exposed to user\n\t  space have expected layout.\n\n\t  KUnit tests run during boot and output the results to the debug\n\t  log in TAP format (https://testanything.org/). Only useful for\n\t  kernel devs running KUnit test harness and are not for inclusion\n\t  into a production build.\n\n\t  For more information on KUnit and unit tests in general, refer\n\t  to the KUnit documentation in Documentation/dev-tools/kunit/.\n\nconfig FIREWIRE_OHCI\n\ttristate \"OHCI-1394 controllers\"\n\tdepends on PCI && FIREWIRE && MMU\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this driver if you have a FireWire controller based\n\t  on the OHCI specification.  For all practical purposes, this\n\t  is the only chipset in use, so say Y here.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be\n\t  called firewire-ohci.\n\nconfig FIREWIRE_SBP2\n\ttristate \"Storage devices (SBP-2 protocol)\"\n\tdepends on FIREWIRE && SCSI\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables you to use SBP-2 devices connected to a\n\t  FireWire bus.  SBP-2 devices include storage devices like\n\t  harddisks and DVD drives, also some other FireWire devices\n\t  like scanners.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be\n\t  called firewire-sbp2.\n\n\t  You should also enable support for disks, CD-ROMs, etc. in the SCSI\n\t  configuration section.\n\nconfig FIREWIRE_NET\n\ttristate \"IP networking over 1394\"\n\tdepends on FIREWIRE && INET\n\thelp\n\t  This enables IPv4/IPv6 over IEEE 1394, providing IP connectivity\n\t  with other implementations of RFC 2734/3146 as found on several\n\t  operating systems.  Multicast support is currently limited.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be\n\t  called firewire-net.\n\nconfig FIREWIRE_NOSY\n\ttristate \"Nosy - a FireWire traffic sniffer for PCILynx cards\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\thelp\n\t  Nosy is an IEEE 1394 packet sniffer that is used for protocol\n\t  analysis and in development of IEEE 1394 drivers, applications,\n\t  or firmwares.\n\n\t  This driver lets you use a Texas Instruments PCILynx 1394 to PCI\n\t  link layer controller TSB12LV21/A/B as a low-budget bus analyzer.\n\t  PCILynx is a nowadays very rare IEEE 1394 controller which is\n\t  not OHCI 1394 compliant.\n\n\t  The following cards are known to be based on PCILynx or PCILynx-2:\n\t  IOI IOI-1394TT (PCI card), Unibrain Fireboard 400 PCI Lynx-2\n\t  (PCI card), Newer Technology FireWire 2 Go (CardBus card),\n\t  Apple Power Mac G3 blue & white and G4 with PCI graphics\n\t  (onboard controller).\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be\n\t  called nosy.  Source code of a userspace interface to nosy, called\n\t  nosy-dump, can be found in tools/firewire/ of the kernel sources.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nendmenu\n",
