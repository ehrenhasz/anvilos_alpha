It serves\n\t  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other\n\t  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because\n\t  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these\n\t  days support PPP rather than SLIP.\n\n\t  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described\n\t  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have\n\t  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.\n\t  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.\n\n\t  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for\n\t  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and\n\t  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for\n\t  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other\n\t  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to\n\t  the next option, \"PPP support for async serial ports\".  For PPP over\n\t  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to \"Support\n\t  synchronous PPP\", below.\n\n\t  If you said Y to \"Version information on all symbols\" above, then\n\t  you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only\n\t  compile it as a module. To compile this driver as a module, choose M\n\t  here. The module will be called ppp_generic.\n\nif PPP\n\nconfig PPP_BSDCOMP\n\ttristate \"PPP BSD-Compress compression\"\n\tdepends on PPP\n\thelp\n\t  Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses\n\t  the LZW compression method to compress each PPP packet before it is\n\t  sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link\n\t  (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression\n\t  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,\n\t  it is safe to say Y here.\n\n\t  The PPP Deflate compression method (\"PPP Deflate compression\",\n\t  above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better\n\t  and is patent-free.\n\n\t  Note that the BSD compression code will always be compiled as a\n\t  module; it is called bsd_comp and will show up in the directory\n\t  modules once you have said \"make modules\". If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig PPP_DEFLATE\n\ttristate \"PPP Deflate compression\"\n\tdepends on PPP\n\tselect ZLIB_INFLATE\n\tselect ZLIB_DEFLATE\n\thelp\n\t  Support for the Deflate compression method for PPP, which uses the\n\t  Deflate algorithm (the same algorithm that gzip uses) to compress\n\t  each PPP packet before it is sent over the wire.  The machine at the\n\t  other end of the PPP link (usually your ISP) has to support the\n\t  Deflate compression method as well for this to be useful.  Even if\n\t  they don't support it, it is safe to say Y here.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.\n\nconfig PPP_FILTER\n\tbool \"PPP filtering\"\n\tdepends on PPP\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to be able to filter the packets passing over\n\t  PPP interfaces.  This allows you to control which packets count as\n\t  activity (i.e. which packets will reset the idle timer or bring up\n\t  a demand-dialed link) and which packets are to be dropped entirely.\n\t  You need to say Y here if you wish to use the pass-filter and\n\t  active-filter options to pppd.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig PPP_MPPE\n\ttristate \"PPP MPPE compression (encryption)\"\n\tdepends on PPP\n\tselect CRYPTO\n\tselect CRYPTO_SHA1\n\tselect CRYPTO_LIB_ARC4\n\thelp\n\t  Support for the MPPE Encryption protocol, as employed by the\n\t  Microsoft Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n\t  See http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/ for information on\n\t  configuring PPTP clients and servers to utilize this method.\n\nconfig PPP_MULTILINK\n\tbool \"PPP multilink support\"\n\tdepends on PPP\n\thelp\n\t  PPP multilink is a protocol (defined in RFC 1990) which allows you\n\t  to combine several (logical or physical) lines into one logical PPP\n\t  connection, so that you can utilize your full bandwidth.\n\n\t  This has to be supported at the other end as well and you need a\n\t  version of the pppd daemon which understands the multilink protocol.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig PPPOATM\n\ttristate \"PPP over ATM\"\n\tdepends on ATM && PPP\n\thelp\n\t  Support PPP (Point to Point Protocol) encapsulated in ATM frames.\n\t  This implementation does not yet comply with section 8 of RFC2364,\n\t  which can lead to bad results if the ATM peer loses state and\n\t  changes its encapsulation unilaterally.\n\nconfig PPPOE\n\ttristate \"PPP over Ethernet\"\n\tdepends on PPP\n\thelp\n\t  Support for PPP over Ethernet.\n\n\t  This driver requires the latest version of pppd from the CVS\n\t  repository at cvs.samba.org.

L2TP is a protocol\n\t  used by ISPs and enterprises to tunnel PPP traffic over UDP\n\t  tunnels. L2TP is replacing PPTP for VPN uses.\nif TTY\n\nconfig PPP_ASYNC\n\ttristate \"PPP support for async serial ports\"\n\tdepends on PPP\n\tselect CRC_CCITT\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y (or M) here if you want to be able to use PPP over standard\n\t  asynchronous serial ports, such as COM1 or COM2 on a PC.  If you use\n\t  a modem (not a synchronous or ISDN modem) to contact your ISP, you\n\t  need this option.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig PPP_SYNC_TTY\n\ttristate \"PPP support for sync tty ports\"\n\tdepends on PPP\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y (or M) here if you want to be able to use PPP over synchronous\n\t  (HDLC) tty devices, such as the SyncLink adapter.
