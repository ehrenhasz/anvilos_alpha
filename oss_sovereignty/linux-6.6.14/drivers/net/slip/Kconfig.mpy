SLIP (Serial Line\n\t  Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over\n\t  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;\n\t  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same\n\t  purpose.\n\n\t  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you\n\t  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP\n\t  around (available from\n\t  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which\n\t  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If\n\t  you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The\n\t  NET-3-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to\n\t  configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just\n\t  want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full\n\t  Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on\n\t  some Internet connected Unix computer. Read\n\t  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>). SLIP\n\t  support will enlarge your kernel by about 4 KB. If unsure, say N.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module\n\t  will be called slip.\n\nconfig SLHC\n\ttristate\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables Van Jacobsen serial line header compression\n\t  routines.\n\nif SLIP\n\nconfig SLIP_COMPRESSED\n\tbool \"CSLIP compressed headers\"\n\tdepends on SLIP\n\tselect SLHC\n\thelp\n\t  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the\n\t  TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported\n\t  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and\n\t  answer Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If\n\t  you plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available from\n\t  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which\n\t  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection, you\n\t  definitely want to say Y here. The NET-3-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to configure\n\t  CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.\n\nconfig SLIP_SMART\n\tbool \"Keepalive and linefill\"\n\tdepends on SLIP\n\thelp\n\t  Adds additional capabilities to the SLIP driver to support the\n\t  RELCOM line fill and keepalive monitoring. Ideal on poor quality\n\t  analogue lines.\n\nconfig SLIP_MODE_SLIP6\n\tbool \"Six bit SLIP encapsulation\"\n\tdepends on SLIP\n\thelp\n\t  Just occasionally you may need to run IP over hostile serial\n\t  networks that don't pass all control characters or are only seven\n\t  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:\n\t  \"slip6\". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over\n\t  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other\n\t  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP\n\t  over the async ports of a Camtec JNT Pad. If unsure, say N.\n\nendif # SLIP\n",
