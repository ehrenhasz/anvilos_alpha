A PLIP link from a Linux box is a popular means to\n\t  install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a\n\t  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies\n\t  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option\n\t  enabled for this to work.\n\n\t  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel\n\t  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected\n\t  with \"null printer\" or \"Turbo Laplink\" cables which can transmit 4\n\t  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on\n\t  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a\n\t  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/plip.rst>.  The cables can be up to\n\t  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows\n\t  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet\n\t  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)\n\t  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.\n\n\t  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well\n\t  as the NET-3-HOWTO, both available from\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that the PLIP\n\t  protocol has been changed and this PLIP driver won't work together\n\t  with the PLIP support in Linux versions 1.0.x.  This option enlarges\n\t  your kernel by about 8 KB.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module\n\t  will be called plip. If unsure, say Y or M, in case you buy\n\t  a laptop later.\n",
