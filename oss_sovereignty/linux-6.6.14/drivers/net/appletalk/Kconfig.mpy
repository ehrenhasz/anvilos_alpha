If your Linux box is connected to such a network and you\n\t  wish to connect to it, say Y.  You will need to use the netatalk package\n\t  so that your Linux box can act as a print and file server for Macs as\n\t  well as access AppleTalk printers.  Check out\n\t  <http://www.zettabyte.net/netatalk/> on the WWW for details.\n\t  EtherTalk is the name used for AppleTalk over Ethernet and the\n\t  cheaper and slower LocalTalk is AppleTalk over a proprietary Apple\n\t  network using serial links.  EtherTalk and LocalTalk are fully\n\t  supported by Linux.\n\n\t  General information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and\n\t  Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/linux_mac_win.html>.  The\n\t  NET3-4-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable\n\t  information as well.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called appletalk. You almost certainly want to compile it as a\n\t  module so you can restart your AppleTalk stack without rebooting\n\t  your machine. I hear that the GNU boycott of Apple is over, so\n\t  even politically correct people are allowed to say Y here.\n\nconfig DEV_APPLETALK\n\ttristate \"Appletalk interfaces support\"\n\tdepends on ATALK\n\thelp\n\t  AppleTalk is the protocol that Apple computers can use to communicate\n\t  on a network.  If your Linux box is connected to such a network, and wish\n\t  to do IP over it, or you have a LocalTalk card and wish to use it to\n\t  connect to the AppleTalk network, say Y.\n\t  \n\nconfig COPS\n\ttristate \"COPS LocalTalk PC support\"\n\tdepends on DEV_APPLETALK && ISA\n\tdepends on NETDEVICES\n\tselect NETDEV_LEGACY_INIT\n\thelp\n\t  This allows you to use COPS AppleTalk cards to connect to LocalTalk\n\t  networks. You also need version 1.3.3 or later of the netatalk\n\t  package. This driver is experimental, which means that it may not\n\t  work. This driver will only work if you choose \"AppleTalk DDP\"\n\t  networking support, above.\n\t  Please read the file\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/appletalk/cops.rst>.\n\nconfig COPS_DAYNA\n\tbool \"Dayna firmware support\"\n\tdepends on COPS\n\thelp\n\t  Support COPS compatible cards with Dayna style firmware (Dayna\n\t  DL2000/ Daynatalk/PC (half length), COPS LT-95, Farallon PhoneNET PC\n\t  III, Farallon PhoneNET PC II).\n\nconfig COPS_TANGENT\n\tbool \"Tangent firmware support\"\n\tdepends on COPS\n\thelp\n\t  Support COPS compatible cards with Tangent style firmware (Tangent\n\t  ATB_II, Novell NL-1000, Daystar Digital LT-200.\n\nconfig IPDDP\n\ttristate \"Appletalk-IP driver support\"\n\tdepends on DEV_APPLETALK && ATALK\n\thelp\n\t  This allows IP networking for users who only have AppleTalk\n\t  networking available. This feature is experimental. With this\n\t  driver, you can encapsulate IP inside AppleTalk (e.g. if your Linux\n\t  box is stuck on an AppleTalk only network) or decapsulate (e.g. if\n\t  you want your Linux box to act as an Internet gateway for a zoo of\n\t  AppleTalk connected Macs). Please see the file\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/ipddp.rst> for more information.\n\n\t  If you say Y here, the AppleTalk-IP support will be compiled into\n\t  the kernel. In this case, you can either use encapsulation or\n\t  decapsulation, but not both. With the following two questions, you\n\t  decide which one you want.\n\n\t  To compile the AppleTalk-IP support as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called ipddp.\n\t  In this case, you will be able to use both encapsulation and\n\t  decapsulation simultaneously, by loading two copies of the module\n\t  and specifying different values for the module option ipddp_mode.\n\nconfig IPDDP_ENCAP\n\tbool \"IP to Appletalk-IP Encapsulation support\"\n\tdepends on IPDDP\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, the AppleTalk-IP code will be able to encapsulate\n\t  IP packets inside AppleTalk frames; this is useful if your Linux box\n\t  is stuck on an AppleTalk network (which hopefully contains a\n\t  decapsulator somewhere).
