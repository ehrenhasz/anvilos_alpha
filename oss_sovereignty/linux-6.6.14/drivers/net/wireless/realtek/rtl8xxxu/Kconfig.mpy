In particular it does not yet support 40MHz channels\n\t  and power management. However it should have a smaller\n\t  memory footprint than the vendor drivers and benefits\n\t  from the in kernel mac80211 stack.\n\n\t  It can coexist with drivers from drivers/staging/rtl8723au,\n\t  drivers/staging/rtl8192u, and drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi,\n\t  but you will need to control which module you wish to load.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will\n\t  be called rtl8xxxu.
