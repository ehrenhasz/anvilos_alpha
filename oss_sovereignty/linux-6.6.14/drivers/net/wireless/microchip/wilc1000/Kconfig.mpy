The Atmel WILC1000 SDIO is a full speed interface.\n\t  It meets SDIO card specification version 2.0. The interface supports\n\t  the 1-bit/4-bit SD transfer mode at the clock range of 0-50 MHz.\n\t  The host can use this interface to read and write from any register\n\t  within the chip as well as configure the WILC1000 for data DMA.\n\t  To use this interface, pin9 (SDIO_SPI_CFG) must be grounded. Select\n\t  this if your platform is using the SDIO bus.\n\nconfig WILC1000_SPI\n\ttristate \"Atmel WILC1000 SPI (WiFi only)\"\n\tdepends on CFG80211 && INET && SPI\n\tselect WILC1000\n\tselect CRC7\n\tselect CRC_ITU_T\n\thelp\n\t  This module adds support for the SPI interface of adapters using\n\t  WILC1000 chipset. The Atmel WILC1000 has a Serial Peripheral\n\t  Interface (SPI) that operates as a SPI slave. This SPI interface can\n\t  be used for control and for serial I/O of 802.11 data. The SPI is a\n\t  full-duplex slave synchronous serial interface that is available\n\t  immediately following reset when pin 9 (SDIO_SPI_CFG) is tied to\n\t  VDDIO. Select this if your platform is using the SPI bus.\n\nconfig WILC1000_HW_OOB_INTR\n\tbool \"WILC1000 out of band interrupt\"\n\tdepends on WILC1000_SDIO\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables out-of-band interrupt support for the WILC1000\n\t  chipset. This OOB interrupt is intended to provide a faster interrupt\n\t  mechanism for SDIO host controllers that don't support SDIO interrupt.\n\t  Select this option If the SDIO host controller in your platform\n\t  doesn't support SDIO time division interrupt.\n",
