This includes the vast\n\t  majority of the PCMCIA 802.11b cards (which are nearly all rebadges)\n\t  - except for the Cisco/Aironet cards.  Cards supported include the\n\t  Apple Airport (not a PCMCIA card), WavelanIEEE/Orinoco,\n\t  Cabletron/EnteraSys Roamabout, ELSA AirLancer, MELCO Buffalo, Avaya,\n\t  IBM High Rate Wireless, Farralon Syyline, Samsung MagicLAN, Netgear\n\t  MA401, LinkSys WPC-11, D-Link DWL-650, 3Com AirConnect, Intel\n\t  IPW2011, and Symbol Spectrum24 High Rate amongst others.\n\n\t  This option includes the guts of the driver, but in order to\n\t  actually use a card you will also need to enable support for PCMCIA\n\t  Hermes cards, PLX9052 based PCI adaptors or the Apple Airport below.\n\n\t  You will also very likely also need the Wireless Tools in order to\n\t  configure your card and that /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts works :\n\t  <https://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>\n\nconfig HERMES_PRISM\n\tbool \"Support Prism 2/2.5 chipset\"\n\tdepends on HERMES\n\thelp\n\n\t  Say Y to enable support for Prism 2 and 2.5 chipsets.

The firmware will remain cached until the\n\t  driver is unloaded.  The cache uses 64K of RAM.\n\n\t  Otherwise load the firmware from userspace as required.  In\n\t  this case the driver should be unloaded and restarted\n\t  whenever the firmware is changed.\n\n\t  If you are not sure, say Y.\n\nconfig APPLE_AIRPORT\n\ttristate \"Apple Airport support (built-in)\"\n\tdepends on PPC_PMAC && HERMES\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to support the Airport 802.11b wireless Ethernet hardware\n\t  built into the Macintosh iBook and other recent PowerPC-based\n\t  Macintosh machines. This is essentially a Lucent Orinoco card with\n\t  a non-standard interface.\n\n\t  This driver does not support the Airport Extreme (802.11b/g).

Several vendors sell such adaptors so that\n\t  802.11b PCMCIA cards can be used in desktop machines.  The Netgear\n\t  MA301 is such an adaptor.\n\nconfig TMD_HERMES\n\ttristate \"Hermes in TMD7160 based PCI adaptor support\"\n\tdepends on PCI && HERMES\n\thelp\n\t  Enable support for PCMCIA cards supported by the \"Hermes\" (aka\n\t  orinoco) driver when used in TMD7160 based PCI adaptors.
