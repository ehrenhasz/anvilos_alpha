These protocols can be accessed directly from userspace\n\t  (e.g. AT commands) or via libraries/tools (e.g. libmbim, libqmi,\n\t  libqcdm...).\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called mhi_wwan_ctrl.\n\nconfig MHI_WWAN_MBIM\n        tristate \"MHI WWAN MBIM network driver for QCOM-based PCIe modems\"\n        depends on MHI_BUS\n        help\n          MHI WWAN MBIM is a WWAN network driver for QCOM-based PCIe modems.\n          It implements MBIM over MHI, for IP data aggregation and muxing.\n          A default wwan0 network interface is created for MBIM data session\n          ID 0.

The connection can be established via QMI/AT from\n\t  userspace with control ports available through the WWAN subsystem\n\t  (CONFIG_RPMSG_WWAN_CTRL) or QRTR network sockets (CONFIG_QRTR).\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called qcom_bam_dmux.\n\nconfig RPMSG_WWAN_CTRL\n\ttristate \"RPMSG WWAN control driver\"\n\tdepends on RPMSG\n\thelp\n\t  RPMSG WWAN CTRL allows modems available via RPMSG channels to expose\n\t  different modem protocols/ports to userspace, including AT and QMI.\n\t  These protocols can be accessed directly from userspace\n\t  (e.g. AT commands) or via libraries/tools (e.g. libqmi, libqcdm...).\n\n\t  This is mainly used for modems integrated into many Qualcomm SoCs,\n\t  e.g. for AT and QMI on Qualcomm MSM8916 or MSM8974. Note that many\n\t  newer Qualcomm SoCs (e.g. SDM845) still provide an AT port through\n\t  this driver but the QMI messages can only be sent through\n\t  QRTR network sockets (CONFIG_QRTR).\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called rpmsg_wwan_ctrl.\n\nconfig IOSM\n\ttristate \"IOSM Driver for Intel M.2 WWAN Device\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\tselect NET_DEVLINK\n\tselect RELAY if WWAN_DEBUGFS\n\thelp\n\t  This driver enables Intel M.2 WWAN Device communication.\n\n\t  If you have one of those Intel M.2 WWAN Modules and wish to use it in\n\t  Linux say Y/M here.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig MTK_T7XX\n\ttristate \"MediaTek PCIe 5G WWAN modem T7xx device\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\tselect RELAY if WWAN_DEBUGFS\n\thelp\n\t  Enables MediaTek PCIe based 5G WWAN modem (T7xx series) device.\n\t  Adapts WWAN framework and provides network interface like wwan0\n\t  and tty interfaces like wwan0at0 (AT protocol), wwan0mbim0\n\t  (MBIM protocol), etc.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called mtk_t7xx.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nendif # WWAN\n\nendmenu\n",
