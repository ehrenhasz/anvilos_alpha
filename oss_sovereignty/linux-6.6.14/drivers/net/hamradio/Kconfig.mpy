This protocol can be used as\n\t  an alternative to KISS for networking over AX.25 amateur radio\n\t  connections, but it has some extended functionality.\n\n\t  Note that this driver is still experimental and might cause\n\t  problems. For details about the features and the usage of the\n\t  driver, read <file:Documentation/networking/6pack.rst>.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called 6pack.\n\nconfig BPQETHER\n\ttristate \"BPQ Ethernet driver\"\n\tdepends on AX25\n\thelp\n\t  AX.25 is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur\n\t  radio. If you say Y here, you will be able to send and receive AX.25\n\t  traffic over Ethernet (also called \"BPQ AX.25\"), which could be\n\t  useful if some other computer on your local network has a direct\n\t  amateur radio connection.\n\nconfig SCC\n\ttristate \"Z8530 SCC driver\"\n\tdepends on ISA && AX25\n\thelp\n\t  These cards are used to connect your Linux box to an amateur radio\n\t  in order to communicate with other computers. If you want to use\n\t  this, read\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/hamradio/z8530drv.rst>\n\t  and the AX25-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Also make sure to say Y\n\t  to \"Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2\" support.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called scc.\n\nconfig SCC_DELAY\n\tbool \"additional delay for PA0HZP OptoSCC compatible boards\"\n\tdepends on SCC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you experience problems with the SCC driver not\n\t  working properly; please read\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/hamradio/z8530drv.rst>\n\t  for details.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig SCC_TRXECHO\n\tbool \"support for TRX that feedback the tx signal to rx\"\n\tdepends on SCC\n\thelp\n\t  Some transmitters feed the transmitted signal back to the receive\n\t  line.  Say Y here to foil this by explicitly disabling the receiver\n\t  during data transmission.\n\n\t  If in doubt, say Y.\n\nconfig BAYCOM_SER_FDX\n\ttristate \"BAYCOM ser12 fullduplex driver for AX.25\"\n\tdepends on AX25 && !S390\n\tselect CRC_CCITT\n\thelp\n\t  This is one of two drivers for Baycom style simple amateur radio\n\t  modems that connect to a serial interface. The driver supports the\n\t  ser12 design in full-duplex mode. In addition, it allows the\n\t  baudrate to be set between 300 and 4800 baud (however not all modems\n\t  support all baudrates). This is the preferred driver. The next\n\t  driver, \"BAYCOM ser12 half-duplex driver for AX.25\" is the old\n\t  driver and still provided in case this driver does not work with\n\t  your serial interface chip. To configure the driver, use the sethdlc\n\t  utility available in the standard ax25 utilities package. For\n\t  information on the modems, see <http://www.baycom.de/> and\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/hamradio/baycom.rst>.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called baycom_ser_fdx.  This is recommended.\n\nconfig BAYCOM_SER_HDX\n\ttristate \"BAYCOM ser12 halfduplex driver for AX.25\"\n\tdepends on AX25 && !S390\n\tselect CRC_CCITT\n\thelp\n\t  This is one of two drivers for Baycom style simple amateur radio\n\t  modems that connect to a serial interface. The driver supports the\n\t  ser12 design in half-duplex mode. This is the old driver.  It is\n\t  still provided in case your serial interface chip does not work with\n\t  the full-duplex driver. This driver is deprecated.  To configure\n\t  the driver, use the sethdlc utility available in the standard ax25\n\t  utilities package.
