If you don't know, then it's probably a\n\t  COM90xx type card, so say Y (or M) to \"ARCnet COM90xx chipset\n\t  support\" below.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will\n\t  be called arcnet.\n\nif ARCNET\n\nconfig ARCNET_1201\n\ttristate \"Enable standard ARCNet packet format (RFC 1201)\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows you to use RFC1201 with your ARCnet card via the virtual\n\t  arc0 device.  You need to say Y here to communicate with\n\t  industry-standard RFC1201 implementations, like the arcether.com\n\t  packet driver or most DOS/Windows ODI drivers.  Please read the\n\t  ARCnet documentation in <file:Documentation/networking/arcnet.rst>\n\t  for more information about using arc0.\n\nconfig ARCNET_1051\n\ttristate \"Enable old ARCNet packet format (RFC 1051)\"\n\thelp\n\t  This allows you to use RFC1051 with your ARCnet card via the virtual\n\t  arc0s device. You only need arc0s if you want to talk to ARCnet\n\t  software complying with the \"old\" standard, specifically, the DOS\n\t  arcnet.com packet driver, Amigas running AmiTCP, and some variants\n\t  of NetBSD. You do not need to say Y here to communicate with\n\t  industry-standard RFC1201 implementations, like the arcether.com\n\t  packet driver or most DOS/Windows ODI drivers. RFC1201 is included\n\t  automatically as the arc0 device. Please read the ARCnet\n\t  documentation in <file:Documentation/networking/arcnet.rst> for more\n\t  information about using arc0e and arc0s.\n\nconfig ARCNET_RAW\n\ttristate \"Enable raw mode packet interface\"\n\thelp\n\t  ARCnet \"raw mode\" packet encapsulation, no soft headers.  Unlikely\n\t  to work unless talking to a copy of the same Linux arcnet driver,\n\t  but perhaps marginally faster in that case.\n\nconfig ARCNET_CAP\n\ttristate \"Enable CAP mode packet interface\"\n\thelp\n\t  ARCnet \"cap mode\" packet encapsulation. Used to get the hardware\n\t  acknowledge back to userspace. After the initial protocol byte every\n\t  packet is stuffed with an extra 4 byte \"cookie\" which doesn't\n\t  actually appear on the network. After transmit the driver will send\n\t  back a packet with protocol byte 0 containing the status of the\n\t  transmission:\n\t     0=no hardware acknowledge\n\t     1=excessive nak\n\t     2=transmission accepted by the receiver hardware\n\n\t  Received packets are also stuffed with the extra 4 bytes but it will\n\t  be random data.\n\n\t  Cap only listens to protocol 1-8.\n\nconfig ARCNET_COM90xx\n\ttristate \"ARCnet COM90xx (normal) chipset driver\"\n\thelp\n\t  This is the chipset driver for the standard COM90xx cards. If you\n\t  have always used the old ARCnet driver without knowing what type of\n\t  card you had, this is probably the one for you.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will\n\t  be called com90xx.\n\nconfig ARCNET_COM90xxIO\n\ttristate \"ARCnet COM90xx (IO mapped) chipset driver\"\n\thelp\n\t  This is the chipset driver for the COM90xx cards, using them in\n\t  IO-mapped mode instead of memory-mapped mode. This is slower than\n\t  the normal driver. Only use it if your card doesn't support shared\n\t  memory.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will\n\t  be called com90io.\n\nconfig ARCNET_RIM_I\n\ttristate \"ARCnet COM90xx (RIM I) chipset driver\"\n\thelp\n\t  This is yet another chipset driver for the COM90xx cards, but this\n\t  time only using memory-mapped mode, and no IO ports at all. This\n\t  driver is completely untested, so if you have one of these cards,\n\t  please mail <dwmw2@infradead.org>, especially if it works!\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will\n\t  be called arc-rimi.\n\nconfig ARCNET_COM20020\n\ttristate \"ARCnet COM20020 chipset driver\"\n\tdepends on LEDS_CLASS\n\thelp\n\t  This is the driver for the new COM20020 chipset. It supports such\n\t  things as promiscuous mode, so packet sniffing is possible, and\n\t  extra diagnostic information.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will\n\t  be called com20020.\n\nconfig ARCNET_COM20020_ISA\n\ttristate \"Support for COM20020 on ISA\"\n\tdepends on ARCNET_COM20020 && ISA\n\nconfig ARCNET_COM20020_PCI\n\ttristate \"Support for COM20020 on PCI\"\n\tdepends on ARCNET_COM20020 && PCI\n\nconfig ARCNET_COM20020_CS\n\ttristate \"COM20020 ARCnet PCMCIA support\"\n\tdepends on ARCNET_COM20020 && PCMCIA\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you intend to attach this type of ARCnet PCMCIA card\n\t  to your computer.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called com20020_cs.  If unsure, say N.\n\nendif # ARCNET\n",
