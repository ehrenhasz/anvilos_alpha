HIPPI\n\t  can run over copper (25m) or fiber (300m on multi-mode or 10km on\n\t  single-mode). HIPPI networks are commonly used for clusters and to\n\t  connect to super computers. If you are connected to a HIPPI network\n\t  and have a HIPPI network card in your computer that you want to use\n\t  under Linux, say Y here (you must also remember to enable the driver\n\t  for your HIPPI card below).
