Some LinkSys PCI cards are\n\t  of this type.  (If your card is NOT SMC EtherPower 10/100 PCI\n\t  (smc9332dst), you can also try the driver for \"Generic DECchip\"\n\t  cards, below.  However, most people with a network card of this type\n\t  will say Y here.)\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will\n\t  be called de2104x.\n\nconfig DE2104X_DSL\n\tint \"Descriptor Skip Length in 32 bit longwords\"\n\tdepends on DE2104X\n\trange 0 31\n\tdefault 0\n\thelp\n\t  Setting this value allows to align ring buffer descriptors into their\n\t  own cache lines. Value of 4 corresponds to the typical 32 byte line\n\t  (the descriptor is 16 bytes). This is necessary on systems that lack\n\t  cache coherence, an example is PowerMac 5500. Otherwise 0 is safe.\n\t  Default is 0, and range is 0 to 31.\n\nconfig TULIP\n\ttristate \"DECchip Tulip (dc2114x) PCI support\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\tselect CRC32\n\thelp\n\t  This driver is developed for the SMC EtherPower series Ethernet\n\t  cards and also works with cards based on the DECchip \n\t  21140 (Tulip series) chips.  Some LinkSys PCI cards are\n\t  of this type.  (If your card is NOT SMC EtherPower 10/100 PCI\n\t  (smc9332dst), you can also try the driver for \"Generic DECchip\"\n\t  cards, above.

The module will\n\t  be called tulip.\n\nconfig TULIP_MWI\n\tbool \"New bus configuration\"\n\tdepends on TULIP\n\thelp\n\t  This configures your Tulip card specifically for the card and\n\t  system cache line size type you are using.\n\n\t  This is experimental code, not yet tested on many boards.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig TULIP_MMIO\n\tbool \"Use PCI shared mem for NIC registers\"\n\tdepends on TULIP\n\thelp\n\t  Use PCI shared memory for the NIC registers, rather than going through\n\t  the Tulip's PIO (programmed I/O ports).  Faster, but could produce\n\t  obscure bugs if your mainboard has memory controller timing issues.\n\t  If in doubt, say N.\n\nconfig TULIP_NAPI\n\tbool \"Use RX polling (NAPI)\"\n\tdepends on TULIP\n\thelp\n\t  NAPI is a new driver API designed to reduce CPU and interrupt load\n\t  when the driver is receiving lots of packets from the card. It is\n\t  still somewhat experimental and thus not yet enabled by default.\n\n\t  If your estimated Rx load is 10kpps or more, or if the card will be\n\t  deployed on potentially unfriendly networks (e.g. in a firewall),\n\t  then say Y here.\n\n\t  If in doubt, say N.\n\nconfig TULIP_NAPI_HW_MITIGATION\n\tbool \"Use Interrupt Mitigation\"\n\tdepends on TULIP_NAPI\n\thelp\n\t  Use HW to reduce RX interrupts. Not strictly necessary since NAPI\n\t  reduces RX interrupts by itself. Interrupt mitigation reduces RX\n\t  interrupts even at low levels of traffic at the cost of a small\n\t  latency.\n\n\t  If in doubt, say Y.\n\nconfig TULIP_DM910X\n\tdef_bool y\n\tdepends on TULIP && SPARC\n\nconfig WINBOND_840\n\ttristate \"Winbond W89c840 Ethernet support\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\tselect CRC32\n\tselect MII\n\thelp\n\t  This driver is for the Winbond W89c840 chip.  It also works with \n\t  the TX9882 chip on the Compex RL100-ATX board.\n\t  More specific information and updates are available from\n\t  <http://www.scyld.com/network/drivers.html>.\n\nconfig DM9102\n\ttristate \"Davicom DM910x/DM980x support\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\tselect CRC32\n\thelp\n\t  This driver is for DM9102(A)/DM9132/DM9801 compatible PCI cards from\n\t  Davicom (<http://www.davicom.com.tw/>).  If you have such a network\n\t  (Ethernet) card, say Y.  Some information is contained in the file\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/dec/dmfe.rst>.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.
