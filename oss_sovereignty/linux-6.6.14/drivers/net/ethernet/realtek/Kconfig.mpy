If you say Y, you will be asked for\n\t  your specific card in the following questions.\n\nif NET_VENDOR_REALTEK\n\nconfig ATP\n\ttristate \"AT-LAN-TEC/RealTek pocket adapter support\"\n\tdepends on PARPORT && X86\n\tselect CRC32\n\thelp\n\t  This is a network (Ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel\n\t  port. Read the file <file:drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/atp.c>\n\t  if you want to use this.  If you intend to use this driver, you\n\t  should have said N to the \"Parallel printer support\", because the two\n\t  drivers don't like each other.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called atp.\n\nconfig 8139CP\n\ttristate \"RealTek RTL-8139 C+ PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\tselect CRC32\n\tselect MII\n\thelp\n\t  This is a driver for the Fast Ethernet PCI network cards based on\n\t  the RTL8139C+ chips. If you have one of those, say Y here.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called 8139cp.  This is recommended.\n\nconfig 8139TOO\n\ttristate \"RealTek RTL-8129/8130/8139 PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\tselect CRC32\n\tselect MII\n\thelp\n\t  This is a driver for the Fast Ethernet PCI network cards based on\n\t  the RTL 8129/8130/8139 chips. If you have one of those, say Y here.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called 8139too.  This is recommended.\n\nconfig 8139TOO_PIO\n\tbool \"Use PIO instead of MMIO\"\n\tdefault y\n\tdepends on 8139TOO\n\thelp\n\t  This instructs the driver to use programmed I/O ports (PIO) instead\n\t  of PCI shared memory (MMIO).  This can possibly solve some problems\n\t  in case your mainboard has memory consistency issues.  If unsure,\n\t  say N.\n\nconfig 8139TOO_TUNE_TWISTER\n\tbool \"Support for uncommon RTL-8139 rev. K (automatic channel equalization)\"\n\tdepends on 8139TOO\n\thelp\n\t  This implements a function which might come in handy in case you\n\t  are using low quality on long cabling. It is required for RealTek\n\t  RTL-8139 revision K boards, and totally unused otherwise.  It tries\n\t  to match the transceiver to the cable characteristics. This is\n\t  experimental since hardly documented by the manufacturer.\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig 8139TOO_8129\n\tbool \"Support for older RTL-8129/8130 boards\"\n\tdepends on 8139TOO\n\thelp\n\t  This enables support for the older and uncommon RTL-8129 and\n\t  RTL-8130 chips, which support MII via an external transceiver,\n\t  instead of an internal one.  Disabling this option will save some\n\t  memory by making the code size smaller.  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig 8139_OLD_RX_RESET\n\tbool \"Use older RX-reset method\"\n\tdepends on 8139TOO\n\thelp\n\t  The 8139too driver was recently updated to contain a more rapid\n\t  reset sequence, in the face of severe receive errors.  This \"new\"\n\t  RX-reset method should be adequate for all boards.  But if you\n\t  experience problems, you can enable this option to restore the\n\t  old RX-reset behavior.  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig R8169\n\ttristate \"Realtek 8169/8168/8101/8125 ethernet support\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\tselect FW_LOADER\n\tselect CRC32\n\tselect PHYLIB\n\tselect REALTEK_PHY\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you have a Realtek Ethernet adapter belonging to\n\t  the following families:\n\t  RTL8169 Gigabit Ethernet\n\t  RTL8168 Gigabit Ethernet\n\t  RTL8101 Fast Ethernet\n\t  RTL8125 2.5GBit Ethernet\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called r8169.
