To compile this driver as a module, choose M\n\t  here, the module will be called mcf8390.\n\nconfig NE2000\n\ttristate \"NE2000/NE1000 support\"\n\tdepends on (ISA || (Q40 && m) || MACH_TX49XX || ATARI_ETHERNEC)\n\tselect NETDEV_LEGACY_INIT if ISA\n\tselect CRC32\n\thelp\n\t  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y here.\n\t  Many Ethernet cards without a specific driver are compatible with\n\t  the NE2000.\n\n\t  If you have a PCI NE2000 card however, say N here and Y to \"PCI\n\t  NE2000 and clone support\" below.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.
