Besides the nominal bitrate of up to\n\t  1 Mbit/s, the data bytes of CAN-FD frames can be transmitted with\n\t  up to 12 Mbit/s. A galvanic isolation of the CAN ports protects the\n\t  electronics of the card and the respective computer against\n\t  disturbances of up to 500 Volts. The PCAN-PCI Express FD can be\n\t  operated with ambient temperatures in a range of -40 to +85 \u00b0C.\n",
