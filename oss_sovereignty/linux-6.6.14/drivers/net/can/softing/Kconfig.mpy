The interface is then identical for PCI\n\t  and PCMCIA cards. This driver operates on a platform device,\n\t  which has been created by softing_cs or softing_pci driver.\n\t  Warning:\n\t  The API of the card does not allow fine control per bus, but\n\t  controls the 2 buses on the card together.\n\t  As such, some actions (start/stop/busoff recovery) on 1 bus\n\t  must bring down the other bus too temporarily.\n\nconfig CAN_SOFTING_CS\n\ttristate \"Softing Gmbh CAN pcmcia cards\"\n\tdepends on PCMCIA\n\tdepends on CAN_SOFTING\n\thelp\n\t  Support for PCMCIA cards from Softing Gmbh & some cards\n\t  from Vector Gmbh.\n\t  You need firmware for these, which you can get at\n\t  https://github.com/linux-can/can-firmware\n\t  This version of the driver is written against\n\t  firmware version 4.6 (softing-fw-4.6-binaries.tar.gz)\n\t  In order to use the card as CAN device, you need the Softing generic\n\t  support too.\n",
