The CAN bus was originally mainly for automotive, but is now\n\t  widely used in marine (NMEA2000), industrial, and medical\n\t  applications. More information on the CAN network protocol family\n\t  PF_CAN is contained in <Documentation/networking/can.rst>.\n\n\t  This section contains all the CAN(-FD) device drivers including the\n\t  virtual ones. If you own such devices or plan to use the virtual CAN\n\t  interfaces to develop applications, say Y here.\n\n\t  To compile as a module, choose M here: the module will be called\n\t  can-dev.\n\nif CAN_DEV\n\nconfig CAN_VCAN\n\ttristate \"Virtual Local CAN Interface (vcan)\"\n\thelp\n\t  Similar to the network loopback devices, vcan offers a\n\t  virtual local CAN interface.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module\n\t  will be called vcan.\n\nconfig CAN_VXCAN\n\ttristate \"Virtual CAN Tunnel (vxcan)\"\n\thelp\n\t  Similar to the virtual ethernet driver veth, vxcan implements a\n\t  local CAN traffic tunnel between two virtual CAN network devices.\n\t  When creating a vxcan, two vxcan devices are created as pair.\n\t  When one end receives the packet it appears on its pair and vice\n\t  versa. The vxcan can be used for cross namespace communication.\n\n\t  In opposite to vcan loopback devices the vxcan only forwards CAN\n\t  frames to its pair and does *not* provide a local echo of sent\n\t  CAN frames. To disable a potential echo in af_can.c the vxcan driver\n\t  announces IFF_ECHO in the interface flags. To have a clean start\n\t  in each namespace the CAN GW hop counter is set to zero.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module\n\t  will be called vxcan.\n\nconfig CAN_NETLINK\n\tbool \"CAN device drivers with Netlink support\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Enables the common framework for CAN device drivers. This is the\n\t  standard library and provides features for the Netlink interface such\n\t  as bittiming validation, support of CAN error states, device restart\n\t  and others.\n\n\t  The additional features selected by this option will be added to the\n\t  can-dev module.\n\n\t  This is required by all platform and hardware CAN drivers. If you\n\t  plan to use such devices or if unsure, say Y.\n\nif CAN_NETLINK\n\nconfig CAN_CALC_BITTIMING\n\tbool \"CAN bit-timing calculation\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  If enabled, CAN bit-timing parameters will be calculated for the\n\t  bit-rate specified via Netlink argument \"bitrate\" when the device\n\t  get started. This works fine for the most common CAN controllers\n\t  with standard bit-rates but may fail for exotic bit-rates or CAN\n\t  source clock frequencies. Disabling saves some space, but then the\n\t  bit-timing parameters must be specified directly using the Netlink\n\t  arguments \"tq\", \"prop_seg\", \"phase_seg1\", \"phase_seg2\" and \"sjw\".\n\n\t  The additional features selected by this option will be added to the\n\t  can-dev module.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CAN_RX_OFFLOAD\n\tbool\n\nconfig CAN_AT91\n\ttristate \"Atmel AT91 onchip CAN controller\"\n\tdepends on (ARCH_AT91 || COMPILE_TEST) && HAS_IOMEM\n\thelp\n\t  This is a driver for the SoC CAN controller in Atmel's AT91SAM9263\n\t  and AT91SAM9X5 processors.\n\nconfig CAN_BXCAN\n\ttristate \"STM32 Basic Extended CAN (bxCAN) devices\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_STM32 || COMPILE_TEST\n\tdepends on HAS_IOMEM\n\tselect CAN_RX_OFFLOAD\n\thelp\n\t  Say yes here to build support for the STMicroelectronics STM32 basic\n\t  extended CAN Controller (bxCAN).\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module\n\t  will be called bxcan.\n\nconfig CAN_CAN327\n\ttristate \"Serial / USB serial ELM327 based OBD-II Interfaces (can327)\"\n\tdepends on TTY\n\tselect CAN_RX_OFFLOAD\n\thelp\n\t  CAN driver for several 'low cost' OBD-II interfaces based on the\n\t  ELM327 OBD-II interpreter chip.\n\n\t  This is a best effort driver - the ELM327 interface was never\n\t  designed to be used as a standalone CAN interface. However, it can\n\t  still be used for simple request-response protocols (such as OBD II),\n\t  and to monitor broadcast messages on a bus (such as in a vehicle).\n\n\t  Please refer to the documentation for information on how to use it:\n\t  Documentation/networking/device_drivers/can/can327.rst\n\n\t  If this driver is built as a module, it will be called can327.\n\nconfig CAN_FLEXCAN\n\ttristate \"Support for Freescale FLEXCAN based chips\"\n\tdepends on OF || COLDFIRE || COMPILE_TEST\n\tdepends on HAS_IOMEM\n\tselect CAN_RX_OFFLOAD\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to support for Freescale FlexCAN.\n\nconfig CAN_GRCAN\n\ttristate \"Aeroflex Gaisler GRCAN and GRHCAN CAN devices\"\n\tdepends on OF && HAS_DMA && HAS_IOMEM\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to use Aeroflex Gaisler GRCAN or GRHCAN.\n\t  Note that the driver supports little endian, even though little\n\t  endian syntheses of the cores would need some modifications on\n\t  the hardware level to work.\n\nconfig CAN_JANZ_ICAN3\n\ttristate \"Janz VMOD-ICAN3 Intelligent CAN controller\"\n\tdepends on MFD_JANZ_CMODIO\n\thelp\n\t  Driver for Janz VMOD-ICAN3 Intelligent CAN controller module, which\n\t  connects to a MODULbus carrier board.\n\n\t  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be\n\t  called janz-ican3.ko.\n\nconfig CAN_KVASER_PCIEFD\n\tdepends on PCI\n\ttristate \"Kvaser PCIe FD cards\"\n\thelp\n\t  This is a driver for the Kvaser PCI Express CAN FD family.\n\n\t  Supported devices:\n\t    Kvaser PCIEcan 4xHS\n\t    Kvaser PCIEcan 2xHS v2\n\t    Kvaser PCIEcan HS v2\n\t    Kvaser PCIEcan 1xCAN v3\n\t    Kvaser PCIEcan 2xCAN v3\n\t    Kvaser PCIEcan 4xCAN v2\n\t    Kvaser Mini PCI Express HS v2\n\t    Kvaser Mini PCI Express 2xHS v2\n\t    Kvaser Mini PCI Express 1xCAN v3\n\t    Kvaser Mini PCI Express 2xCAN v3\n\nconfig CAN_SLCAN\n\ttristate \"Serial / USB serial CAN Adaptors (slcan)\"\n\tdepends on TTY\n\thelp\n\t  CAN driver for several 'low cost' CAN interfaces that are attached\n\t  via serial lines or via USB-to-serial adapters using the LAWICEL\n\t  ASCII protocol. The driver implements the tty linediscipline N_SLCAN.\n\n\t  As only the sending and receiving of CAN frames is implemented, this\n\t  driver should work with the (serial/USB) CAN hardware from:\n\t  www.canusb.com / www.can232.com / www.mictronics.de / www.canhack.de\n\n\t  Userspace tools to attach the SLCAN line discipline (slcan_attach,\n\t  slcand) can be found in the can-utils at the linux-can project, see\n\t  https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils for details.\n\n\t  The slcan driver supports up to 10 CAN netdevices by default which\n\t  can be changed by the 'maxdev=xx' module option. This driver can\n\t  also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called slcan.\n\nconfig CAN_SUN4I\n\ttristate \"Allwinner A10 CAN controller\"\n\tdepends on MACH_SUN4I || MACH_SUN7I || (RISCV && ARCH_SUNXI) || COMPILE_TEST\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to use CAN controller found on Allwinner\n\t  A10/A20/D1 SoCs.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will\n\t  be called sun4i_can.\n\nconfig CAN_TI_HECC\n\tdepends on ARM\n\ttristate \"TI High End CAN Controller\"\n\tselect CAN_RX_OFFLOAD\n\thelp\n\t  Driver for TI HECC (High End CAN Controller) module found on many\n\t  TI devices.
