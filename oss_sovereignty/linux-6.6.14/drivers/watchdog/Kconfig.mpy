This\n\t  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back\n\t  on-line as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog\n\t  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to\n\t  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which\n\t  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside\n\t  your computer. For details, read\n\t  <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.rst> in the kernel source.\n\n\t  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon\n\t  which is available from\n\t  <https://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon\n\t  can also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the\n\t  process table is full.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nif WATCHDOG\n\nconfig WATCHDOG_CORE\n\ttristate \"WatchDog Timer Driver Core\"\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to use the new watchdog timer driver core.\n\t  This driver provides a framework for all watchdog timer drivers\n\t  and gives them the /dev/watchdog interface (and later also the\n\t  sysfs interface).\n\nconfig WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT\n\tbool \"Disable watchdog shutdown on close\"\n\thelp\n\t  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is\n\t  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file\n\t  /dev/watchdog.
