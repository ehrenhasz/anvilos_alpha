These cables are plugged into your USB\n\t  port and provide USB compatibility to peripherals designed with\n\t  parallel port interfaces.\n\n\t  The chip has two modes: automatic mode and manual mode. In automatic\n\t  mode, it looks to the computer like a standard USB printer. Only\n\t  printers may be connected to the USS-720 in this mode. The generic\n\t  USB printer driver (\"USB Printer support\", above) may be used in\n\t  that mode, and you can say N here if you want to use the chip only\n\t  in this mode.\n\n\t  Manual mode is not limited to printers, any parallel port\n\t  device should work. This driver utilizes manual mode.\n\t  Note however that some operations are three orders of magnitude\n\t  slower than on a PCI/ISA Parallel Port, so timing critical\n\t  applications might not work.\n\n\t  Say Y here if you own an USS-720 USB->Parport cable and intend to\n\t  connect anything other than a printer to it.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called uss720.\n\nconfig USB_EMI62\n\ttristate \"EMI 6|2m USB Audio interface support\"\n\thelp\n\t  This driver loads firmware to Emagic EMI 6|2m low latency USB\n\t  Audio and Midi interface.\n\n\t  After firmware load the device is handled with standard linux\n\t  USB Audio driver.\n\n\t  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be\n\t  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).\n\t  The module will be called audio.
