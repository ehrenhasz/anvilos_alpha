The ULPI specification defines a standard set\n\t  of registers that can be used to detect the vendor and product which\n\t  allows ULPI to be handled as a bus. This module is the driver for that\n\t  bus.\n\n\t  The ULPI interfaces (the buses) are registered by the drivers for USB\n\t  controllers which support ULPI register access and have ULPI PHY\n\t  attached to them. The ULPI PHY drivers themselves are normal PHY\n\t  drivers.\n\n\t  ULPI PHYs provide often functions such as ADP sensing/probing (OTG\n\t  protocol) and USB charger detection.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will\n\t  be called ulpi.\n\nconfig USB_CONN_GPIO\n\ttristate \"USB GPIO Based Connection Detection Driver\"\n\tdepends on GPIOLIB\n\tselect USB_ROLE_SWITCH\n\tselect POWER_SUPPLY\n\thelp\n\t  The driver supports USB role switch between host and device via GPIO\n\t  based USB cable detection, used typically if an input GPIO is used\n\t  to detect USB ID pin, and another input GPIO may be also used to detect\n\t  Vbus pin at the same time, it also can be used to enable/disable\n\t  device if an input GPIO is only used to detect Vbus pin.\n\n\t  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will\n\t  be called usb-conn-gpio.ko\n",
