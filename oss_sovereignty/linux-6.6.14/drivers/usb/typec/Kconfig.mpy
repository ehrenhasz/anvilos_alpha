The Configuration Channel may also be used to detect optional\n\t  Accessory Modes - Analog Audio and Debug - and if USB Power Delivery\n\t  is supported, the Alternate Modes, where the connector is used for\n\t  something else then USB communication.\n\n\t  USB Power Delivery Specification defines a protocol that can be used\n\t  to negotiate the voltage and current levels with the connected\n\t  partners. USB Power Delivery allows higher voltages then the normal\n\t  5V, up to 20V, and current up to 5A over the cable. The USB Power\n\t  Delivery protocol is also used to negotiate the optional Alternate\n\t  Modes when they are supported. USB Power Delivery does not depend on\n\t  USB Type-C connector, however it is mostly used together with USB\n\t  Type-C connectors.\n\n\t  USB Type-C and USB Power Delivery Specifications define a set of state\n\t  machines that need to be implemented in either software or firmware.\n\t  Simple USB Type-C PHYs, for example USB Type-C Port Controller\n\t  Interface Specification compliant \"Port Controllers\" need the state\n\t  machines to be handled in the OS, but stand-alone USB Type-C and Power\n\t  Delivery controllers handle the state machines inside their firmware.\n\t  The USB Type-C and Power Delivery controllers usually function\n\t  autonomously, and do not necessarily require drivers.\n\n\t  Enable this configurations option if you have USB Type-C connectors on\n\t  your system and 1) you know your USB Type-C hardware requires OS\n\t  control (a driver) to function, or 2) if you need to be able to read\n\t  the status of the USB Type-C ports in your system, or 3) if you need\n\t  to be able to swap the power role (decide are you supplying or\n\t  consuming power over the cable) or data role (host or device) when\n\t  both roles are supported.\n\n\t  For more information, see the kernel documentation for USB Type-C\n\t  Connector Class API (Documentation/driver-api/usb/typec.rst)\n\t  <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/usb/typec.html>\n\t  and ABI (Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-typec).\n\nif TYPEC\n\nsource \"drivers/usb/typec/tcpm/Kconfig\"\n\nsource \"drivers/usb/typec/ucsi/Kconfig\"\n\nsource \"drivers/usb/typec/tipd/Kconfig\"\n\nconfig TYPEC_ANX7411\n\ttristate \"Analogix ANX7411 Type-C DRP Port controller driver\"\n\tdepends on I2C\n\tdepends on USB_ROLE_SWITCH\n\tdepends on POWER_SUPPLY\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y or M here if your system has Analogix ANX7411 Type-C DRP Port\n\t  controller driver.\n\n\t  If you choose to build this driver as a dynamically linked module, the\n\t  module will be called anx7411.ko.\n\nconfig TYPEC_RT1719\n\ttristate \"Richtek RT1719 Sink Only Type-C controller driver\"\n\tdepends on USB_ROLE_SWITCH || !USB_ROLE_SWITCH\n\tdepends on I2C\n\tdepends on POWER_SUPPLY\n\tselect REGMAP_I2C\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y or M here if your system has Richtek RT1719 sink only\n\t  Type-C port controller driver.\n\n\t  If you choose to build this driver as a dynamically linked module, the\n\t  module will be called rt1719.ko\n\nconfig TYPEC_HD3SS3220\n\ttristate \"TI HD3SS3220 Type-C DRP Port controller driver\"\n\tdepends on I2C\n\tdepends on USB_ROLE_SWITCH\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y or M here if your system has TI HD3SS3220 Type-C DRP Port\n\t  controller driver.\n\n\t  If you choose to build this driver as a dynamically linked module, the\n\t  module will be called hd3ss3220.ko.\n\nconfig TYPEC_STUSB160X\n\ttristate \"STMicroelectronics STUSB160x Type-C controller driver\"\n\tdepends on USB_ROLE_SWITCH || !USB_ROLE_SWITCH\n\tdepends on I2C\n\tselect REGMAP_I2C\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y or M here if your system has STMicroelectronics STUSB160x\n\t  Type-C port controller.\n\n\t  If you choose to build this driver as a dynamically linked module, the\n\t  module will be called stusb160x.ko.\n\nconfig TYPEC_WUSB3801\n\ttristate \"Willsemi WUSB3801 Type-C port controller driver\"\n\tdepends on I2C\n\tselect REGMAP_I2C\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y or M here if your system has a WUSB3801 Type-C port controller.\n\n\t  If you choose to build this driver as a dynamically linked module, the\n\t  module will be called wusb3801.ko.\n\nsource \"drivers/usb/typec/mux/Kconfig\"\n\nsource \"drivers/usb/typec/altmodes/Kconfig\"\n\nendif # TYPEC\n",
