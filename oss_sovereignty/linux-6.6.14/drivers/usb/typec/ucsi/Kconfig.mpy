On UCSI system the USB Type-C ports\n\t  function autonomously by default, but in order to get the status of\n\t  the ports and support basic operations like role swapping, the driver\n\t  is required. UCSI is available on most of the new Intel based systems\n\t  that are equipped with Embedded Controller and USB Type-C ports.\n\n\t  UCSI specification does not define the interface method, so depending\n\t  on the platform, ACPI, PCI, I2C, etc. may be used. Therefore this\n\t  driver only provides the core part, and separate drivers are needed\n\t  for every supported interface method.\n\n\t  The UCSI specification can be downloaded from:\n\t  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/io/universal-serial-bus/usb-type-c-ucsi-spec.html\n\n\t  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called typec_ucsi.\n\nif TYPEC_UCSI\n\nconfig UCSI_CCG\n\ttristate \"UCSI Interface Driver for Cypress CCGx\"\n\tdepends on I2C\n\thelp\n\t  This driver enables UCSI support on platforms that expose a\n\t  Cypress CCGx Type-C controller over I2C interface.\n\n\t  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be\n\t  called ucsi_ccg.\n\nconfig UCSI_ACPI\n\ttristate \"UCSI ACPI Interface Driver\"\n\tdepends on ACPI\n\thelp\n\t  This driver enables UCSI support on platforms that expose UCSI\n\t  interface as ACPI device.
