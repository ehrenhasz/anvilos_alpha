Think of it as a\n\t\tvideo console for blind people.  If built in to the\n\t\tkernel, it can speak everything on the text console from\n\t\tboot up to shutdown.  For more information on Speakup,\n\t\tpoint your browser at <http://www.linux-speakup.org/>.\n\t\tThere is also a mailing list at the above url that you\n\t\tcan subscribe to.\n\n\t\tSupported synthesizers are accent sa, accent pc,\n\t\tappollo II., Auddapter, Braille 'n Speak, Dectalk\n\t\texternal (old), Dectalk PC (full length isa board),\n\t\tDectalk express, Doubletalk, Doubletalk LT or\n\t\tLitetalk, Keynote Gold internal PC, software\n\t\tsynthesizers, Speakout, transport, and a dummy module\n\t\tthat can be used with a plain text terminal.\n\n\t\tSpeakup can either be built in or compiled as a module\n\t\tby answering y or m.  If you answer y here, then you\n\t\tmust answer either y or m to at least one of the\n\t\tsynthesizer drivers below.  If you answer m here, then\n\t\tthe synthesizer drivers below can only be built as\n\t\tmodules.\n\n\t\tThese drivers are not standalone drivers, but must be\n\t\tused in conjunction with Speakup.  Think of them as\n\t\tvideo cards for blind people.\n\n\n\t\tThe Dectalk pc driver can only be built as a module, and\n\t\trequires software to be pre-loaded on to the card before\n\t\tthe module can be loaded.  See the decpc choice below\n\t\tfor more details.\n\n\t\tIf you are not a blind person, or don't have access to\n\t\tone of the listed synthesizers, you should say n.\n\nif SPEAKUP\n\nconfig SPEAKUP_SERIALIO\n\tdef_bool y\n\tdepends on ISA || COMPILE_TEST\n\tdepends on HAS_IOPORT\n\nconfig SPEAKUP_SYNTH_ACNTSA\n\ttristate \"Accent SA synthesizer support\"\n\thelp\n\t\tThis is the Speakup driver for the Accent SA\n\t\tsynthesizer.
