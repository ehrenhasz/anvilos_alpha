They\n\t  were also used in servers from the E-class to the K-class.  They\n\t  are not found in B1000, C3000, J5000, A500, L1000, N4000 and upwards.\n\t  If in doubt, say \"Y\".\n\nconfig HPPB\n\tbool \"HP-PB bus support\"\n\tdepends on GSC\n\thelp\n\t  The HP-PB bus was used in the Nova class and K-class servers.\n\t  If in doubt, say \"Y\"\n\nconfig IOMMU_CCIO\n\tbool \"U2/Uturn I/O MMU\"\n\tdepends on GSC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to enable DMA management routines for the first\n\t  generation of PA-RISC cache-coherent machines.  Programs the\n\t  U2/Uturn chip in \"Virtual Mode\" and use the I/O MMU.\n\nconfig GSC_LASI\n\tbool \"Lasi I/O support\"\n\tdepends on GSC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to support the Lasi multifunction chip found in\n\t  many PA-RISC workstations & servers.\tIt includes interfaces\n\t  for a parallel port, serial port, NCR 53c710 SCSI, Apricot\n\t  Ethernet, Harmony audio, PS/2 keyboard & mouse, ISDN, telephony\n\t  and floppy.  Note that you must still enable all the individual\n\t  drivers for these chips.\n\nconfig GSC_WAX\n\tbool \"Wax I/O support\"\n\tdepends on GSC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to support the Wax multifunction chip found in some\n\t  older systems, including B/C/D/R class and 715/64, 715/80 and\n\t  715/100.  Wax includes an EISA adapter, a serial port (not always\n\t  used), a HIL interface chip and is also known to be used as the\n\t  GSC bridge for an X.25 GSC card.\n\nconfig ISA\n\tbool \"ISA support\"\n\tdepends on EISA\n\thelp\n\t  If you want to plug an ISA card into your EISA bus, say Y here.\n\t  Most people should say N.\n\nconfig GSC_DINO\n\tbool \"GSCtoPCI/Dino PCI support\"\n\tdepends on PCI && GSC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to support the Dino & Cujo GSC to PCI bridges found in\n\t  machines from the B132 to the C360, the J2240 and the A180.  Some\n\t  GSC/HSC cards (eg gigabit & dual 100 Mbit Ethernet) have a Dino on\n\t  the card, and you also need to say Y here if you have such a card.\n\t  Note that Dino also supplies one of the serial ports on certain\n\t  machines.  If in doubt, say Y.\n\nconfig PCI_LBA\n\tbool \"LBA/Elroy PCI support\"\n\tdepends on PCI\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to support the Elroy PCI Lower Bus Adapter.  This is\n\t  present on B, C, J, L and N-class machines with 4-digit model\n\t  numbers and the A400/A500.\n\nconfig IOSAPIC\n\tbool\n\tdepends on PCI_LBA\n\tdefault PCI_LBA\n\nconfig IOMMU_SBA\n\tbool\n\tdepends on PCI_LBA\n\tdefault PCI_LBA\n\nendmenu\n\nmenu \"PA-RISC specific drivers\"\n\nconfig SUPERIO\n\tbool \"SuperIO (SuckyIO) support\"\n\tdepends on PCI_LBA\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to support the SuperIO chip found in Bxxxx, C3xxx and\n\t  J5xxx+ machines. This enables IDE, Floppy, Parallel Port, and\n\t  Serial port on those machines.\n\nconfig CHASSIS_LCD_LED\n\tbool \"Chassis LCD and LED support\"\n\tdepends on LEDS_CLASS=y\n\tdefault y\n\tselect LEDS_TRIGGERS\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to enable support for the Heartbeat,\n\t  Disk/Network activities LEDs on some PA-RISC machines,\n\t  or support for the LCD that can be found on recent material.\n\t\n\t  This has nothing to do with LED State support for A and E class.\n\t\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig PDC_CHASSIS\n\tbool \"PDC chassis state codes support\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to enable support for Chassis codes.\n\t  That includes support for LED State front panel as found on E\n\t  class, and support for the GSP Virtual Front Panel (LED State and\n\t  message logging)  as found on high end servers such as A, L and\n\t  N-class.\n\t  This driver will also display progress messages on LCD display,\n\t  such as \"INI\", \"RUN\" and \"FLT\", and might thus clobber messages\n\t  shown by the LED/LCD driver.\n\t  This driver updates the state panel (LED and/or LCD) upon system\n\t  state change (eg: boot, shutdown or panic).\n\t  \n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\n\nconfig PDC_CHASSIS_WARN\n\tbool \"PDC chassis warnings support\"\n\tdepends on PROC_FS\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to enable support for Chassis warnings.\n\t  This will add a proc entry '/proc/chassis' giving some information\n\t  about the overall health state of the system.\n\t  This includes NVRAM battery level, overtemp or failures such as\n\t  fans or power units.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\n\nconfig PDC_STABLE\n\ttristate \"PDC Stable Storage support\"\n\tdepends on SYSFS\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to enable support for accessing Stable Storage\n\t  variables (PDC non volatile variables such as Primary Boot Path,\n\t  Console Path, Autoboot, Autosearch, etc) through SysFS.\n\t\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\t\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.\n\t  The module will be called pdc_stable.\n\nendmenu\n",
