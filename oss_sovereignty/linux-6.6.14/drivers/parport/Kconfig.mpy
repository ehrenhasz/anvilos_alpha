To compile parallel port support as a module, choose M here:\n\t  the module will be called parport.\n\t  If you have more than one parallel port and want to specify which\n\t  port and IRQ to be used by this driver at module load time, take a\n\t  look at <file:Documentation/admin-guide/parport.rst>.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nif PARPORT\n\nconfig PARPORT_PC\n\ttristate \"PC-style hardware\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_PARPORT || PCI\n\tdepends on HAS_IOPORT\n\thelp\n\t  You should say Y here if you have a PC-style parallel port. All\n\t  IBM PC compatible computers and some Alphas have PC-style\n\t  parallel ports.  PA-RISC owners should only say Y here if they\n\t  have a SuperIO parallel port.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called parport_pc.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig PARPORT_SERIAL\n\ttristate \"Multi-IO cards (parallel and serial)\"\n\tdepends on SERIAL_8250_PCI && PARPORT_PC && PCI\n\thelp\n\t  This adds support for multi-IO PCI cards that have parallel and\n\t  serial ports.  You should say Y or M here.  If you say M, the module\n\t  will be called parport_serial.\n\nconfig PARPORT_PC_FIFO\n\tbool \"Use FIFO/DMA if available\"\n\tdepends on PARPORT_PC\n\thelp\n\t  Many parallel port chipsets provide hardware that can speed up\n\t  printing. Say Y here if you want to take advantage of that.\n\n\t  As well as actually having a FIFO, or DMA capability, the kernel\n\t  will need to know which IRQ the parallel port has.  By default,\n\t  parallel port interrupts will not be used, and so neither will the\n\t  FIFO.  See <file:Documentation/admin-guide/parport.rst> to find out how to\n\t  specify which IRQ/DMA to use.\n\nconfig PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO\n\tbool \"SuperIO chipset support\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_PARPORT && PARPORT_PC && !PARISC\n\thelp\n\t  Saying Y here enables some probes for Super-IO chipsets in order to\n\t  find out things like base addresses, IRQ lines and DMA channels.  It\n\t  is safe to say N.\n\nconfig PARPORT_PC_PCMCIA\n\ttristate \"Support for PCMCIA management for PC-style ports\"\n\tdepends on PCMCIA && PARPORT_PC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you need PCMCIA support for your PC-style parallel\n\t  ports. If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig PARPORT_IP32\n\ttristate \"SGI IP32 builtin port\"\n\tdepends on SGI_IP32\n\tselect PARPORT_NOT_PC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port on\n\t  SGI O2 machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),\n\t  called parport_ip32.  If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.\n\nconfig PARPORT_AMIGA\n\ttristate \"Amiga builtin port\"\n\tdepends on AMIGA\n\tselect PARPORT_NOT_PC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port hardware on\n\t  Amiga machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),\n\t  called parport_amiga. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.\n\nconfig PARPORT_MFC3\n\ttristate \"Multiface III parallel port\"\n\tdepends on ZORRO\n\tselect PARPORT_NOT_PC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you need parallel port support for the MFC3 card.\n\t  This code is also available as a module (say M), called\n\t  parport_mfc3. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.\n\nconfig PARPORT_ATARI\n\ttristate \"Atari hardware\"\n\tdepends on ATARI\n\tselect PARPORT_NOT_PC\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port hardware on\n\t  Atari machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),\n\t  called parport_atari. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.\n\nconfig PARPORT_GSC\n\ttristate\n\tdefault GSC\n\tselect PARPORT_NOT_PC\n\nconfig PARPORT_SUNBPP\n\ttristate \"Sparc hardware\"\n\tdepends on SBUS\n\tselect PARPORT_NOT_PC\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for the bidirectional parallel port\n\t  found on many Sun machines. Note that many of the newer Ultras\n\t  actually have pc style hardware instead.\n\nconfig PARPORT_1284\n\tbool \"IEEE 1284 transfer modes\"\n\thelp\n\t  If you have a printer that supports status readback or device ID, or\n\t  want to use a device that uses enhanced parallel port transfer modes\n\t  such as EPP and ECP, say Y here to enable advanced IEEE 1284\n\t  transfer modes. Also say Y if you want device ID information to\n\t  appear in /proc/sys/dev/parport/*/autoprobe*. It is safe to say N.\n\nconfig PARPORT_NOT_PC\n\tbool\n\nendif # PARPORT\n",
