This includes standard PS/2\n\t  keyboard and mouse.\n\n\t  Say N here if you have a headless (no monitor, no keyboard) system.\n\n\t  More information is available: <file:Documentation/input/input.rst>\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called input.\n\nif INPUT\n\nconfig INPUT_LEDS\n\ttristate \"Export input device LEDs in sysfs\"\n\tdepends on LEDS_CLASS\n\tdefault INPUT\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to export LEDs on input devices\n\t  as standard LED class devices in sysfs.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called input-leds.\n\nconfig INPUT_FF_MEMLESS\n\ttristate \"Support for memoryless force-feedback devices\"\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you have memoryless force-feedback input device\n\t  such as Logitech WingMan Force 3D, ThrustMaster FireStorm Dual\n\t  Power 2, or similar. You will also need to enable hardware-specific\n\t  driver.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called ff-memless.\n\nconfig INPUT_SPARSEKMAP\n\ttristate \"Sparse keymap support library\"\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you are using a driver for an input\n\t  device that uses sparse keymap. This option is only\n\t  useful for out-of-tree drivers since in-tree drivers\n\t  select it automatically.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called sparse-keymap.\n\nconfig INPUT_MATRIXKMAP\n\ttristate \"Matrix keymap support library\"\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you are using a driver for an input\n\t  device that uses matrix keymap.
