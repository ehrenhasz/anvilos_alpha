It\n\t  consists of multiple global clock domains, which can be reset by\n\t  means of the CCU control registers. These domains and devices placed\n\t  in them are fed with clocks generated by a hierarchy of PLLs,\n\t  configurable and fixed clock dividers.

They are used to generate high frequency\n\t  signals, which are either directly wired to the consumers (like\n\t  CPUs, DDR, etc.) or passed over the clock dividers to be only\n\t  then used as an individual reference clock of a target device.\n\nconfig CLK_BT1_CCU_DIV\n\tbool \"Baikal-T1 CCU Dividers support\"\n\tselect MFD_SYSCON\n\tdefault MIPS_BAIKAL_T1\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this to support the CCU dividers used to distribute clocks\n\t  between AXI-bus and system devices coming from CCU PLLs of Baikal-T1\n\t  SoC.
