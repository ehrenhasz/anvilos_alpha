It enables send/receive 'struct dma_fence' objects to/from\n\t  userspace via Sync File fds for synchronization between drivers via\n\t  userspace components. It has been ported from Android.\n\n\t  The first and main user for this is graphics in which a fence is\n\t  associated with a buffer. When a job is submitted to the GPU a fence\n\t  is attached to the buffer and is transferred via userspace, using Sync\n\t  Files fds, to the DRM driver for example. More details at\n\t  Documentation/driver-api/sync_file.rst.\n\nconfig SW_SYNC\n\tbool \"Sync File Validation Framework\"\n\tdefault n\n\tdepends on SYNC_FILE\n\tdepends on DEBUG_FS\n\thelp\n\t  A sync object driver that uses a 32bit counter to coordinate\n\t  synchronization.  Useful when there is no hardware primitive backing\n\t  the synchronization.\n\n\t  WARNING: improper use of this can result in deadlocking kernel\n\t  drivers from userspace. Intended for test and debug only.\n\nconfig UDMABUF\n\tbool \"userspace dmabuf misc driver\"\n\tdefault n\n\tdepends on DMA_SHARED_BUFFER\n\tdepends on MEMFD_CREATE || COMPILE_TEST\n\thelp\n\t  A driver to let userspace turn memfd regions into dma-bufs.\n\t  Qemu can use this to create host dmabufs for guest framebuffers.\n\nconfig DMABUF_MOVE_NOTIFY\n\tbool \"Move notify between drivers (EXPERIMENTAL)\"\n\tdefault n\n\tdepends on DMA_SHARED_BUFFER\n\thelp\n\t  Don't pin buffers if the dynamic DMA-buf interface is available on\n\t  both the exporter as well as the importer. This fixes a security\n\t  problem where userspace is able to pin unrestricted amounts of memory\n\t  through DMA-buf.\n\t  This is marked experimental because we don't yet have a consistent\n\t  execution context and memory management between drivers.\n\nconfig DMABUF_DEBUG\n\tbool \"DMA-BUF debug checks\"\n\tdepends on DMA_SHARED_BUFFER\n\tdefault y if DMA_API_DEBUG\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables additional checks for DMA-BUF importers and\n\t  exporters.
