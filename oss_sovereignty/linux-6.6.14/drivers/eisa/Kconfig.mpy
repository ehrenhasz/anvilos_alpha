The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and\n\t  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.\n\n\t  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.\n\n\t  Otherwise, say N.\n\nconfig EISA_VLB_PRIMING\n\tbool \"Vesa Local Bus priming\"\n\tdepends on X86 && EISA\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  Activate this option if your system contains a Vesa Local\n\t  Bus (VLB) card that identify itself as an EISA card (such as\n\t  the Adaptec AHA-284x).\n\n\t  When in doubt, say N.\n\nconfig EISA_PCI_EISA\n\tbool \"Generic PCI/EISA bridge\"\n\tdepends on !PARISC && PCI && EISA\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Activate this option if your system contains a PCI to EISA\n\t  bridge.

This database increases size of the kernel\n\t  image by about 40KB, but it gets freed after the system\n\t  boots up, so it doesn't take up kernel memory. Anyway, if\n\t  you are building an installation floppy or kernel for an\n\t  embedded system where kernel image size really matters, you\n\t  can disable this feature and you'll get device ID instead of\n\t  names.\n\n\t  When in doubt, say Y.\n",
