Set to N unless your\n\tuserspace has been updated to handle the new location.\n\n\tAdditionally, it also causes the char device names to be offset\n\tby one so that chip 0 will have /dev/scom1 and chip1 /dev/scom2\n\tto match old userspace expectations.\n\n\tNew userspace will use udev rules to generate predictable access\n\tsymlinks in /dev/fsi/by-path when this option is enabled.\n\nconfig FSI_MASTER_GPIO\n\ttristate \"GPIO-based FSI master\"\n\tdepends on GPIOLIB\n\tselect CRC4\n\thelp\n\tThis option enables a FSI master driver using GPIO lines.\n\nconfig FSI_MASTER_HUB\n\ttristate \"FSI hub master\"\n\thelp\n\tThis option enables a FSI hub master driver.  Hub is a type of FSI\n\tmaster that is connected to the upstream master via a slave.  Hubs\n\tallow chaining of FSI links to an arbitrary depth.  This allows for\n\ta high target device fanout.\n\nconfig FSI_MASTER_AST_CF\n\ttristate \"FSI master based on Aspeed ColdFire coprocessor\"\n\tdepends on GPIOLIB\n\tdepends on GPIO_ASPEED\n\tselect GENERIC_ALLOCATOR\n\thelp\n\tThis option enables a FSI master using the AST2400 and AST2500 GPIO\n\tlines driven by the internal ColdFire coprocessor. This requires\n\tthe corresponding machine specific ColdFire firmware to be available.\n\nconfig FSI_MASTER_ASPEED\n\ttristate \"FSI ASPEED master\"\n\tdepends on HAS_IOMEM\n\thelp\n\t This option enables a FSI master that is present behind an OPB bridge\n\t in the AST2600.\n\n\t Enable it for your BMC kernel in an OpenPower or IBM Power system.\n\nconfig FSI_MASTER_I2CR\n\ttristate \"IBM I2C Responder virtual FSI master\"\n\tdepends on I2C\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables a virtual FSI master in order to access a CFAM\n\t  behind an IBM I2C Responder (I2CR) chip. The I2CR is an I2C device\n\t  that translates I2C commands to CFAM or SCOM operations, effectively\n\t  implementing an FSI master and bus.\n\nconfig FSI_SCOM\n\ttristate \"SCOM FSI client device driver\"\n\thelp\n\tThis option enables an FSI based SCOM device driver.\n\nconfig FSI_SBEFIFO\n\ttristate \"SBEFIFO FSI client device driver\"\n\tdepends on OF_ADDRESS\n\thelp\n\tThis option enables an FSI based SBEFIFO device driver. The SBEFIFO is\n\ta pipe-like FSI device for communicating with the self boot engine\n\t(SBE) on POWER processors.\n\nconfig FSI_OCC\n\ttristate \"OCC SBEFIFO client device driver\"\n\tdepends on FSI_SBEFIFO\n\thelp\n\tThis option enables an SBEFIFO based On-Chip Controller (OCC) device\n\tdriver. The OCC is a device embedded on a POWER processor that collects\n\tand aggregates sensor data from the processor and system. The OCC can\n\tprovide the raw sensor data as well as perform thermal and power\n\tmanagement on the system.\n\nconfig I2CR_SCOM\n\ttristate \"IBM I2C Responder SCOM driver\"\n\tdepends on FSI_MASTER_I2CR\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables an I2C Responder based SCOM device driver. The\n\t  I2CR has the capability to directly perform SCOM operations instead\n\t  of using the FSI2PIB engine.\n\nendif\n",
