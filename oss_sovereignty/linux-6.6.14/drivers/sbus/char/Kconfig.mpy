The driver implements a SunOS-compatible\n\t  interface and a NetBSD-compatible interface.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called openprom.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig OBP_FLASH\n\ttristate \"OBP Flash Device support\"\n\tdepends on SPARC64\n\thelp\n\t  The OpenBoot PROM on Ultra systems is flashable. If you want to be\n\t  able to upgrade the OBP firmware, say Y here.\n\nconfig TADPOLE_TS102_UCTRL\n\ttristate \"Tadpole TS102 Microcontroller support\"\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here to directly support the TS102 Microcontroller interface\n\t  on the Tadpole Sparcbook 3.  This device handles power-management\n\t  events, and can also notice the attachment/detachment of external\n\t  monitors and mice.\n\nconfig BBC_I2C\n\ttristate \"UltraSPARC-III bootbus i2c controller driver\"\n\tdepends on PCI && SPARC64\n\thelp\n\t  The BBC devices on the UltraSPARC III have two I2C controllers.  The\n\t  first I2C controller connects mainly to configuration PROMs (NVRAM,\n\t  CPU configuration, DIMM types, etc.).  The second I2C controller\n\t  connects to environmental control devices such as fans and\n\t  temperature sensors.  The second controller also connects to the\n\t  smartcard reader, if present.  Say Y to enable support for these.\n\nconfig ENVCTRL\n\ttristate \"SUNW, envctrl support\"\n\tdepends on PCI && SPARC64\n\thelp\n\t  Kernel support for temperature and fan monitoring on Sun SME\n\t  machines.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called envctrl.\n\nconfig DISPLAY7SEG\n\ttristate \"7-Segment Display support\"\n\tdepends on PCI && SPARC64\n\thelp\n\t  This is the driver for the 7-segment display and LED present on\n\t  Sun Microsystems CompactPCI models CP1400 and CP1500.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called display7seg.\n\n\t  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or\n\t  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with a 7-segment display,\n\t  you should say N to this option.\n\nconfig ORACLE_DAX\n\ttristate \"Oracle Data Analytics Accelerator\"\n\tdepends on SPARC64\n\tdefault m\n\thelp\n\t Driver for Oracle Data Analytics Accelerator, which is\n\t a coprocessor that performs database operations in hardware.\n\t It is available on M7 and M8 based systems only.\n\nendmenu\n\n",
