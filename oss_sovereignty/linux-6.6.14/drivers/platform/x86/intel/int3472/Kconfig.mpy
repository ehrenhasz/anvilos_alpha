On machines designed for Chrome OS\n\t  it maps to a TPS68470 camera PMIC. On machines designed for Windows,\n\t  it maps to either a TP68470 camera PMIC, a uP6641Q sensor PMIC, or a\n\t  set of discrete GPIOs and power gates.\n\n\t  If your device was designed for Chrome OS, this driver will provide\n\t  an ACPI OpRegion, which must be available before any of the devices\n\t  using it are probed. For this reason, you should select Y if your\n\t  device was designed for ChromeOS. For the same reason the\n\t  I2C_DESIGNWARE_PLATFORM option must be set to Y too.\n\n\t  Say Y or M here if you have a SkyLake device designed for use\n\t  with Windows or ChromeOS. Say N here if you are not sure.\n\n\t  The module will be named \"intel-skl-int3472\".\n",
