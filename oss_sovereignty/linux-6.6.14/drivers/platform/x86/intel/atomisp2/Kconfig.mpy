Linux currently does not have a\n\t  driver for these, so they do not work as a camera. Some of these\n\t  camera's have a LED which is controlled through a GPIO.\n\n\t  Some of these devices have a firmware issue where the LED gets turned\n\t  on at boot. This driver will turn the LED off at boot and also allows\n\t  controlling the LED (repurposing it) through the sysfs LED interface.\n\n\t  Which GPIO is attached to the LED is usually not described in the\n\t  ACPI tables, so this driver contains per-system info about the GPIO\n\t  inside the driver, this means that this driver only works on systems\n\t  the driver knows about.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called intel_atomisp2_led.\n\nconfig INTEL_ATOMISP2_PM\n\ttristate \"Intel AtomISP v2 dummy / power-management driver\"\n\tdepends on PCI && IOSF_MBI && PM\n\tdepends on !INTEL_ATOMISP\n\tselect INTEL_ATOMISP2_PDX86\n\thelp\n\t  Power-management driver for Intel's Image Signal Processor found on\n\t  Bay Trail and Cherry Trail devices.
