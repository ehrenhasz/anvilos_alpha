This includes a driver for the Surface Serial Hub (SSH), which\n\t  is the device responsible for the communication with the EC, and a\n\t  basic kernel interface exposing the EC functionality to other client\n\t  drivers, i.e. allowing them to make requests to the EC and receive\n\t  events from it. Selecting this option alone will not provide any\n\t  client drivers and therefore no functionality beyond the in-kernel\n\t  interface. Said functionality is the responsibility of the respective\n\t  client drivers.\n\n\t  Note: While 4th-generation Surface devices also make use of a SAM EC,\n\t  due to a difference in the communication interface of the controller,\n\t  only 5th and later generations are currently supported. Specifically,\n\t  devices using SAM-over-SSH are supported, whereas devices using\n\t  SAM-over-HID, which is used on the 4th generation, are currently not\n\t  supported.\n\n\t  Choose m if you want to build the SAM subsystem core and SSH driver as\n\t  module, y if you want to build it into the kernel and n if you don't\n\t  want it at all.\n\nconfig SURFACE_AGGREGATOR_BUS\n\tbool \"Surface System Aggregator Module Bus\"\n\tdepends on SURFACE_AGGREGATOR\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Expands the Surface System Aggregator Module (SSAM) core driver by\n\t  providing a dedicated bus and client-device type.\n\n\t  This bus and device type are intended to provide and simplify support\n\t  for non-platform and non-ACPI SSAM devices, i.e. SSAM devices that are\n\t  not auto-detectable via the conventional means (e.g. ACPI).\n\nconfig SURFACE_AGGREGATOR_ERROR_INJECTION\n\tbool \"Surface System Aggregator Module Error Injection Capabilities\"\n\tdepends on SURFACE_AGGREGATOR\n\tdepends on FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION\n\thelp\n\t  Provides error-injection capabilities for the Surface System\n\t  Aggregator Module subsystem and Surface Serial Hub driver.\n\n\t  Specifically, exports error injection hooks to be used with the\n\t  kernel's function error injection capabilities to simulate underlying\n\t  transport and communication problems, such as invalid data sent to or\n\t  received from the EC, dropped data, and communication timeouts.\n\t  Intended for development and debugging.\n",
