The sets of registers for sysfs access\n\t  are defined per system type bases and include the registers related\n\t  to system resets operation, system reset causes monitoring and some\n\t  kinds of mux selection.\n\nconfig MLXREG_LC\n\ttristate \"Mellanox line card platform driver support\"\n\tdepends on HWMON\n\tdepends on I2C\n\tselect REGMAP\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for the Mellanox MSN4800-XX line cards,\n\t  which are the part of MSN4800 Ethernet modular switch systems\n\t  providing a high performance switching solution for Enterprise Data\n\t  Centers (EDC) for building Ethernet based clusters, High-Performance\n\t  Computing (HPC) and embedded environments.\n\nconfig MLXBF_TMFIFO\n\ttristate \"Mellanox BlueField SoC TmFifo platform driver\"\n\tdepends on ARM64\n\tdepends on ACPI\n\tdepends on VIRTIO_CONSOLE && VIRTIO_NET\n\thelp\n\t  Say y here to enable TmFifo support. The TmFifo driver provides\n\t  platform driver support for the TmFifo which supports console\n\t  and networking based on the virtio framework.\n\nconfig MLXBF_BOOTCTL\n\ttristate \"Mellanox BlueField Firmware Boot Control driver\"\n\tdepends on ARM64\n\tdepends on ACPI\n\tdepends on NET\n\thelp\n\t  The Mellanox BlueField firmware implements functionality to\n\t  request swapping the primary and alternate eMMC boot partition,\n\t  and to set up a watchdog that can undo that swap if the system\n\t  does not boot up correctly. This driver provides sysfs access\n\t  to the userspace tools, to be used in conjunction with the eMMC\n\t  device driver to do necessary initial swap of the boot partition.\n\nconfig MLXBF_PMC\n\ttristate \"Mellanox BlueField Performance Monitoring Counters driver\"\n\tdepends on ARM64\n\tdepends on HWMON\n\tdepends on ACPI\n\thelp\n\t  Say y here to enable PMC support. The PMC driver provides access\n\t  to performance monitoring counters within various blocks in the\n\t  Mellanox BlueField SoC via a sysfs interface.\n\nconfig NVSW_SN2201\n\ttristate \"Nvidia SN2201 platform driver support\"\n\tdepends on HWMON && I2C\n\tdepends on ACPI || COMPILE_TEST\n\tselect REGMAP_I2C\n\thelp\n\t  This driver provides support for the Nvidia SN2201 platform.\n\t  The SN2201 is a highly integrated for one rack unit system with\n\t  L3 management switches. It has 48 x 1Gbps RJ45 + 4 x 100G QSFP28\n\t  ports in a compact 1RU form factor. The system also including a\n\t  serial port (RS-232 interface), an OOB port (1G/100M MDI interface)\n\t  and USB ports for management functions.\n\t  The processor used on SN2201 is Intel Atom\u00aeProcessor C Series,\n\t  C3338R which is one of the Denverton product families.\n\t  System equipped with Nvidia\u00aeSpectrum-1 32x100GbE Ethernet switch.\n\nendif # MELLANOX_PLATFORM\n",
