This is a nice method to save power, because \n\t  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.\n\n\t  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU\n\t  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor\n\t  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.\n\n\t  For details, take a look at\n\t  <file:Documentation/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.rst>.\n\n\t  If in doubt, say N.\n\nif CPU_FREQ\n\nconfig CPU_FREQ_GOV_ATTR_SET\n\tbool\n\nconfig CPU_FREQ_GOV_COMMON\n\tselect CPU_FREQ_GOV_ATTR_SET\n\tselect IRQ_WORK\n\tbool\n\nconfig CPU_FREQ_STAT\n\tbool \"CPU frequency transition statistics\"\n\thelp\n\t  Export CPU frequency statistics information through sysfs.\n\n\t  If in doubt, say N.\n\nchoice\n\tprompt \"Default CPUFreq governor\"\n\tdefault CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_USERSPACE if ARM_SA1110_CPUFREQ\n\tdefault CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_SCHEDUTIL if ARM64 || ARM\n\tdefault CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_SCHEDUTIL if (X86_INTEL_PSTATE || X86_AMD_PSTATE) && SMP\n\tdefault CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE\n\thelp\n\t  This option sets which CPUFreq governor shall be loaded at\n\t  startup.
