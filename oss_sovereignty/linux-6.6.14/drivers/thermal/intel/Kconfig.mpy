Each package will have its own thermal zone. There are\n\t  two trip points which can be set by user to get notifications via thermal\n\t  notification methods.\n\nconfig INTEL_SOC_DTS_IOSF_CORE\n\ttristate\n\tdepends on X86 && PCI\n\tselect IOSF_MBI\n\tselect INTEL_TCC\n\thelp\n\t  This is becoming a common feature for Intel SoCs to expose the additional\n\t  digital temperature sensors (DTSs) using side band interface (IOSF). This\n\t  implements the common set of helper functions to register, get temperature\n\t  and get/set thresholds on DTSs.\n\nconfig INTEL_SOC_DTS_THERMAL\n\ttristate \"Intel SoCs DTS thermal driver\"\n\tdepends on X86 && PCI && ACPI\n\tselect INTEL_SOC_DTS_IOSF_CORE\n\tselect THERMAL_WRITABLE_TRIPS\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this to register Intel SoCs (e.g. Bay Trail) platform digital\n\t  temperature sensor (DTS). These SoCs have two additional DTSs in\n\t  addition to DTSs on CPU cores. Each DTS will be registered as a\n\t  thermal zone. There are two trip points. One of the trip point can\n\t  be set by user mode programs to get notifications via Linux thermal\n\t  notification methods.The other trip is a critical trip point, which\n\t  was set by the driver based on the TJ MAX temperature.\n\nconfig INTEL_QUARK_DTS_THERMAL\n\ttristate \"Intel Quark DTS thermal driver\"\n\tdepends on X86_INTEL_QUARK\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this to register Intel Quark SoC (e.g. X1000) platform digital\n\t  temperature sensor (DTS). For X1000 SoC, it has one on-die DTS.\n\t  The DTS will be registered as a thermal zone. There are two trip points:\n\t  hot & critical. The critical trip point default value is set by\n\t  underlying BIOS/Firmware.\n\nmenu \"ACPI INT340X thermal drivers\"\nsource \"drivers/thermal/intel/int340x_thermal/Kconfig\"\nendmenu\n\nconfig INTEL_BXT_PMIC_THERMAL\n\ttristate \"Intel Broxton PMIC thermal driver\"\n\tdepends on X86 && INTEL_SOC_PMIC_BXTWC\n\tselect REGMAP\n\thelp\n\t  Select this driver for Intel Broxton PMIC with ADC channels monitoring\n\t  system temperature measurements and alerts.\n\t  This driver is used for monitoring the ADC channels of PMIC and handles\n\t  the alert trip point interrupts and notifies the thermal framework with\n\t  the trip point and temperature details of the zone.\n\nconfig INTEL_PCH_THERMAL\n\ttristate \"Intel PCH Thermal Reporting Driver\"\n\tdepends on X86 && PCI\n\tselect THERMAL_ACPI if ACPI\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this to support thermal reporting on certain intel PCHs.\n\t  Thermal reporting device will provide temperature reading,\n\t  programmable trip points and other information.\n\nconfig INTEL_TCC_COOLING\n\ttristate \"Intel TCC offset cooling Driver\"\n\tdepends on X86\n\tselect INTEL_TCC\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this to support system cooling by adjusting the effective TCC\n\t  activation temperature via the TCC Offset register, which is widely\n\t  supported on modern Intel platforms.\n\t  Note that, on different platforms, the behavior might be different\n\t  on how fast the setting takes effect, and how much the CPU frequency\n\t  is reduced.\n\nconfig INTEL_HFI_THERMAL\n\tbool \"Intel Hardware Feedback Interface\"\n\tdepends on NET\n\tdepends on CPU_SUP_INTEL\n\tdepends on X86_THERMAL_VECTOR\n\tselect THERMAL_NETLINK\n\thelp\n\t  Select this option to enable the Hardware Feedback Interface.
