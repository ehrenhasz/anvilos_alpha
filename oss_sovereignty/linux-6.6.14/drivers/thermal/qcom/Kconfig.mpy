It shows up in sysfs as a thermal sensor with multiple\n\t  trip points. The temperature reported by the thermal sensor reflects the\n\t  real time die temperature if an ADC is present or an estimate of the\n\t  temperature based upon the over temperature stage value.\n\nconfig QCOM_LMH\n\ttristate \"Qualcomm Limits Management Hardware\"\n\tdepends on ARCH_QCOM && QCOM_SCM\n\thelp\n\t  This enables initialization of Qualcomm limits management\n\t  hardware(LMh). LMh allows for hardware-enforced mitigation for cpus based on\n\t  input from temperature and current sensors.  On many newer Qualcomm SoCs\n\t  LMh is configured in the firmware and this feature need not be enabled.\n\t  However, on certain SoCs like sdm845 LMh has to be configured from kernel.\n",
