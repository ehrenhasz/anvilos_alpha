Also the PNPBIOS can help prevent resource\n\t  conflicts between mainboard devices and other bus devices.\n\n\t  Note: ACPI is expected to supersede PNPBIOS some day, currently it\n\t  co-exists nicely.  If you have a non-ISA system that supports ACPI,\n\t  you probably don't need PNPBIOS support.\n\nconfig PNPBIOS_PROC_FS\n\tbool \"Plug and Play BIOS /proc interface\"\n\tdepends on PNPBIOS && PROC_FS\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here and to \"/proc file system support\", you will be\n\t  able to directly access the PNPBIOS.  This includes resource\n\t  allocation, ESCD, and other PNPBIOS services.  Using this\n\t  interface is potentially dangerous because the PNPBIOS driver will\n\t  not be notified of any resource changes made by writing directly.\n\t  Also some buggy systems will fault when accessing certain features\n\t  in the PNPBIOS /proc interface (e.g. \"boot\" configs).\n\n\t  See the latest pcmcia-cs (stand-alone package) for a nice set of\n\t  PNPBIOS /proc interface tools (lspnp and setpnp).\n\n\t  Unless you are debugging or have other specific reasons, it is\n\t  recommended that you say N here.\n\n",
