It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and\n\t  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through\n\t  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know\n\t  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.\n\n\t  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different\n\t  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of\n\t  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X\n\t  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.\n\t  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the\n\t  only way to use the graphics hardware.\n\n\t  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located\n\t  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.\n\n\t  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame\n\t  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.rst>\n\t  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at\n\t  <http://www.munted.org.uk/programming/Framebuffer-HOWTO-1.3.html> for more\n\t  information.\n\n\t  This enables support for native frame buffer device (fbdev) drivers.\n\n\t  The DRM subsystem provides support for emulated frame buffer devices\n\t  on top of KMS drivers, but this option allows legacy fbdev drivers to\n\t  be enabled as well.\n\n\t  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you\n\t  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.\n\n\t  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you\n\t  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that\n\t  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware\n\t  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer\n\t  device-aware may cause unexpected results.
