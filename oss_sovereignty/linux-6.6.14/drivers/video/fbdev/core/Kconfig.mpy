Enable this if DDC/I2C\n\t  transfers do not work for your driver and if you are using\n\t  nvidiafb, i810fb or savagefb.\n\n\t  In general, choosing Y for this option is safe.  If you\n\t  experience extremely long delays while booting before you get\n\t  something on your display, try setting this to N.  Matrox cards in\n\t  combination with certain motherboards and monitors are known to\n\t  suffer from this problem.\n\nconfig FB_DEVICE\n\tbool \"Provide legacy /dev/fb* device\"\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\tdefault FB\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want the legacy /dev/fb* device file and\n\t  interfaces within sysfs anc procfs. It is only required if you\n\t  have userspace programs that depend on fbdev for graphics output.\n\t  This does not affect the framebuffer console. If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig FB_DDC\n\ttristate\n\tdepends on FB\n\tselect I2C_ALGOBIT\n\tselect I2C\n\nconfig FB_CFB_FILLRECT\n\ttristate\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\thelp\n\t  Include the cfb_fillrect function for generic software rectangle\n\t  filling.

This is used by drivers that don't provide their own\n\t  (accelerated) version and the framebuffer is in system RAM.\n\nconfig FB_SYS_COPYAREA\n\ttristate\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\thelp\n\t  Include the sys_copyarea function for generic software area copying.\n\t  This is used by drivers that don't provide their own (accelerated)\n\t  version and the framebuffer is in system RAM.\n\nconfig FB_SYS_IMAGEBLIT\n\ttristate\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\thelp\n\t  Include the sys_imageblit function for generic software image\n\t  blitting.

Most probably you don't have such hardware,\n\t  so it's safe to say \"n\" here.\n\nchoice\n\tprompt \"Choice endianness support\"\n\tdepends on FB_FOREIGN_ENDIAN\n\nconfig FB_BOTH_ENDIAN\n\tbool \"Support for Big- and Little-Endian framebuffers\"\n\nconfig FB_BIG_ENDIAN\n\tbool \"Support for Big-Endian framebuffers only\"\n\nconfig FB_LITTLE_ENDIAN\n\tbool \"Support for Little-Endian framebuffers only\"\n\nendchoice\n\nconfig FB_SYS_FOPS\n\ttristate\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\nconfig FB_DEFERRED_IO\n\tbool\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\nconfig FB_DMAMEM_HELPERS\n\tbool\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\tselect FB_SYS_COPYAREA\n\tselect FB_SYS_FILLRECT\n\tselect FB_SYS_FOPS\n\tselect FB_SYS_IMAGEBLIT\n\nconfig FB_IOMEM_HELPERS\n\tbool\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\tselect FB_CFB_COPYAREA\n\tselect FB_CFB_FILLRECT\n\tselect FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT\n\nconfig FB_SYSMEM_HELPERS\n\tbool\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\tselect FB_SYS_COPYAREA\n\tselect FB_SYS_FILLRECT\n\tselect FB_SYS_FOPS\n\tselect FB_SYS_IMAGEBLIT\n\nconfig FB_SYSMEM_HELPERS_DEFERRED\n\tbool\n\tdepends on FB_CORE\n\tselect FB_DEFERRED_IO\n\tselect FB_SYSMEM_HELPERS\n\nconfig FB_BACKLIGHT\n\ttristate\n\tdepends on FB\n\tselect BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE\n\nconfig FB_MODE_HELPERS\n\tbool \"Enable Video Mode Handling Helpers\"\n\tdepends on FB\n\thelp\n\t  This enables functions for handling video modes using the\n\t  Generalized Timing Formula and the EDID parser. A few drivers rely\n\t  on this feature such as the radeonfb, rivafb, and the i810fb. If\n\t  your driver does not take advantage of this feature, choosing Y will\n\t  just increase the kernel size by about 5K.\n\nconfig FB_TILEBLITTING\n\tbool \"Enable Tile Blitting Support\"\n\tdepends on FB\n\thelp\n\t  This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique\n\t  where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas\n\t  the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the\n\t  default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed\n\t  parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.\n\t  For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,\n\t  an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a\n\t  rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in\n\t  terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.\n\n\t  This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If\n\t  unsure, say N.\n",
