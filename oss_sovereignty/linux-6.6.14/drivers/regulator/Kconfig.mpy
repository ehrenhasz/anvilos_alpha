It's intended to\n\t  provide voltage and current control to client or consumer drivers and\n\t  also provide status information to user space applications through a\n\t  sysfs interface.\n\n\t  The intention is to allow systems to dynamically control regulator\n\t  output in order to save power and prolong battery life.
