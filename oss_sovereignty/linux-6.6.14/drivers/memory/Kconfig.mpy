To preserve the bootloader provided timings, the reset\n\t  of GPMC is skipped during init. Enable this during development to\n\t  configure devices connected to the GPMC bus.\n\n\t  NOTE: In addition to matching the register setup with the bootloader\n\t  you also need to match the GPMC FCLK frequency used by the\n\t  bootloader or else the GPMC timings won't be identical with the\n\t  bootloader timings.\n\nconfig TI_EMIF_SRAM\n\ttristate \"Texas Instruments EMIF SRAM driver\"\n\tdepends on SOC_AM33XX || SOC_AM43XX || (ARM && CPU_V7 && COMPILE_TEST)\n\tdepends on SRAM\n\thelp\n\t  This driver is for the EMIF module available on Texas Instruments\n\t  AM33XX and AM43XX SoCs and is required for PM.
