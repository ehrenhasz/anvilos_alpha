This results in some non-visible but addressable characters,\n\t  and is the case for most parallel LCDs. Other LCDs, and some serial ones,\n\t  however, use the same line width internally as what is visible. The KS0074\n\t  for example, uses 16 characters per line for 16 visible characters per line.\n\n\t  This option lets you configure the value used by your LCD in 'custom' profile.\n\t  If you don't know, put '40' here.\n\nconfig PANEL_LCD_HWIDTH\n\tdepends on PANEL_PROFILE=\"0\" && PANEL_LCD=\"1\"\n\tint \"Hardware LCD line width (1-64, 64 by default)\"\n\trange 1 64\n\tdefault 64\n\thelp\n\t  Most LCDs use a single address bit to differentiate line 0 and line 1. Since\n\t  some of them need to be able to address 40 chars with the lower bits, they\n\t  often use the immediately superior power of 2, which is 64, to address the\n\t  next line.\n\n\t  If you don't know what your LCD uses, in doubt let 16 here for a 2x16, and\n\t  64 here for a 2x40.\n\nconfig PANEL_LCD_CHARSET\n\tdepends on PANEL_PROFILE=\"0\" && PANEL_LCD=\"1\"\n\tint \"LCD character set (0=normal, 1=KS0074)\"\n\trange 0 1\n\tdefault 0\n\thelp\n\t  Some controllers such as the KS0074 use a somewhat strange character set\n\t  where many symbols are at unusual places.

But before assigning signals, the driver needs to know if it will\n\t  be driving a serial LCD or a parallel one. Serial LCDs only use 2 wires\n\t  (SDA/SCL), while parallel ones use 2 or 3 wires for the control signals\n\t  (E, RS, sometimes RW), and 4 or 8 for the data. Use 0 here for a 8 bits\n\t  parallel LCD, and 1 for a serial LCD.\n\nconfig PANEL_LCD_PIN_E\n\tdepends on PANEL_PROFILE=\"0\" && PANEL_LCD=\"1\" && PANEL_LCD_PROTO=\"0\"\n\tint \"Parallel port pin number & polarity connected to the LCD E signal (-17...17) \"\n\trange -17 17\n\tdefault 14\n\thelp\n\t  This describes the number of the parallel port pin to which the LCD 'E'\n\t  signal has been connected.
