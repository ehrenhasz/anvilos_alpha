A cpio archive should contain a filesystem archive\n\t  to be used as an initramfs image.  Directories should contain a\n\t  filesystem layout to be included in the initramfs image.  Files\n\t  should contain entries according to the format described by the\n\t  \"usr/gen_init_cpio\" program in the kernel tree.\n\n\t  When multiple directories and files are specified then the\n\t  initramfs image will be the aggregate of all of them.\n\n\t  See <file:Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/early_userspace_support.rst> for more details.\n\n\t  If you are not sure, leave it blank.\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_FORCE\n\tbool \"Ignore the initramfs passed by the bootloader\"\n\tdepends on CMDLINE_EXTEND || CMDLINE_FORCE\n\thelp\n\t  This option causes the kernel to ignore the initramfs image\n\t  (or initrd image) passed to it by the bootloader.

Several compression algorithms are\n\t  available, which differ in efficiency, compression and\n\t  decompression speed.  Compression speed is only relevant\n\t  when building a kernel.  Decompression speed is relevant at\n\t  each boot. Also the memory usage during decompression may become\n\t  relevant on memory constrained systems. This is usually based on the\n\t  dictionary size of the algorithm with algorithms like XZ and LZMA\n\t  featuring large dictionary sizes.\n\n\t  High compression options are mostly useful for users who are\n\t  low on RAM, since it reduces the memory consumption during\n\t  boot.\n\n\t  Keep in mind that your build system needs to provide the appropriate\n\t  compression tool to compress the generated initram cpio file for\n\t  embedding.\n\n\t  If in doubt, select 'None'\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_GZIP\n\tbool \"Gzip\"\n\tdepends on RD_GZIP\n\thelp\n\t  Use the old and well tested gzip compression algorithm. Gzip provides\n\t  a good balance between compression ratio and decompression speed and\n\t  has a reasonable compression speed. It is also more likely to be\n\t  supported by your build system as the gzip tool is present by default\n\t  on most distros.\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_BZIP2\n\tbool \"Bzip2\"\n\tdepends on RD_BZIP2\n\thelp\n\t  It's compression ratio and speed is intermediate. Decompression speed\n\t  is slowest among the choices. The initramfs size is about 10% smaller\n\t  with bzip2, in comparison to gzip. Bzip2 uses a large amount of\n\t  memory. For modern kernels you will need at least 8MB RAM or more for\n\t  booting.\n\n\t  If you choose this, keep in mind that you need to have the bzip2 tool\n\t  available to be able to compress the initram.\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_LZMA\n\tbool \"LZMA\"\n\tdepends on RD_LZMA\n\thelp\n\t  This algorithm's compression ratio is best but has a large dictionary\n\t  size which might cause issues in memory constrained systems.\n\t  Decompression speed is between the other choices. Compression is\n\t  slowest. The initramfs size is about 33% smaller with LZMA in\n\t  comparison to gzip.\n\n\t  If you choose this, keep in mind that you may need to install the xz\n\t  or lzma tools to be able to compress the initram.\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_XZ\n\tbool \"XZ\"\n\tdepends on RD_XZ\n\thelp\n\t  XZ uses the LZMA2 algorithm and has a large dictionary which may cause\n\t  problems on memory constrained systems. The initramfs size is about\n\t  30% smaller with XZ in comparison to gzip. Decompression speed is\n\t  better than that of bzip2 but worse than gzip and LZO. Compression is\n\t  slow.\n\n\t  If you choose this, keep in mind that you may need to install the xz\n\t  tool to be able to compress the initram.\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_LZO\n\tbool \"LZO\"\n\tdepends on RD_LZO\n\thelp\n\t  It's compression ratio is the second poorest amongst the choices. The\n\t  kernel size is about 10% bigger than gzip. Despite that, it's\n\t  decompression speed is the second fastest and it's compression speed\n\t  is quite fast too.\n\n\t  If you choose this, keep in mind that you may need to install the lzop\n\t  tool to be able to compress the initram.\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_LZ4\n\tbool \"LZ4\"\n\tdepends on RD_LZ4\n\thelp\n\t  It's compression ratio is the poorest amongst the choices. The kernel\n\t  size is about 15% bigger than gzip; however its decompression speed\n\t  is the fastest.\n\n\t  If you choose this, keep in mind that most distros don't provide lz4\n\t  by default which could cause a build failure.\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_ZSTD\n\tbool \"ZSTD\"\n\tdepends on RD_ZSTD\n\thelp\n\t  ZSTD is a compression algorithm targeting intermediate compression\n\t  with fast decompression speed. It will compress better than GZIP and\n\t  decompress around the same speed as LZO, but slower than LZ4.\n\n\t  If you choose this, keep in mind that you may need to install the zstd\n\t  tool to be able to compress the initram.\n\nconfig INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_NONE\n\tbool \"None\"\n\thelp\n\t  Do not compress the built-in initramfs at all. This may sound wasteful\n\t  in space, but, you should be aware that the built-in initramfs will be\n\t  compressed at a later stage anyways along with the rest of the kernel,\n\t  on those architectures that support this. However, not compressing the\n\t  initramfs may lead to slightly higher memory consumption during a\n\t  short time at boot, while both the cpio image and the unpacked\n\t  filesystem image will be present in memory simultaneously\n\nendchoice\n",
