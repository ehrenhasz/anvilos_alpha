You want to read <https://www.tapr.org/>\n\t  and more specifically about AX.25 on Linux\n\t  <https://linux-ax25.in-berlin.de>.\n\n\t  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the\n\t  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all\n\t  the questions about amateur radio.\n\ncomment \"Packet Radio protocols\"\n\tdepends on HAMRADIO\n\nconfig AX25\n\ttristate \"Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2 protocol\"\n\tdepends on HAMRADIO\n\thelp\n\t  This is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur\n\t  radio. It is either used by itself for point-to-point links, or to\n\t  carry other protocols such as tcp/ip. To use it, you need a device\n\t  that connects your Linux box to your amateur radio. You can either\n\t  use a low speed TNC (a Terminal Node Controller acts as a kind of\n\t  modem connecting your computer's serial port to your radio's\n\t  microphone input and speaker output) supporting the KISS protocol or\n\t  one of the various SCC cards that are supported by the generic Z8530\n\t  or the DMA SCC driver. Another option are the Baycom modem serial\n\t  and parallel port hacks or the sound card modem (supported by their\n\t  own drivers). If you say Y here, you also have to say Y to one of\n\t  those drivers.\n\n\t  Information about where to get supporting software for Linux amateur\n\t  radio as well as information about how to configure an AX.25 port is\n\t  contained in the AX25-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <https://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You might also want to\n\t  check out the file <file:Documentation/networking/ax25.rst> in the\n\t  kernel source. More information about digital amateur radio in\n\t  general is on the WWW at\n\t  <https://www.tapr.org/>.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the\n\t  module will be called ax25.\n\nconfig AX25_DAMA_SLAVE\n\tbool \"AX.25 DAMA Slave support\"\n\tdefault y\n\tdepends on AX25\n\thelp\n\t  DAMA is a mechanism to prevent collisions when doing AX.25\n\t  networking. A DAMA server (called \"master\") accepts incoming traffic\n\t  from clients (called \"slaves\") and redistributes it to other slaves.\n\t  If you say Y here, your Linux box will act as a DAMA slave; this is\n\t  transparent in that you don't have to do any special DAMA\n\t  configuration. Linux cannot yet act as a DAMA server.  This option\n\t  only compiles DAMA slave support into the kernel.  It still needs to\n\t  be enabled at runtime.  For more about DAMA see\n\t  <https://linux-ax25.in-berlin.de>.  If unsure, say Y.\n\n# placeholder until implemented\nconfig AX25_DAMA_MASTER\n\tbool 'AX.25 DAMA Master support'\n\tdepends on AX25_DAMA_SLAVE && BROKEN\n\thelp\n\t  DAMA is a mechanism to prevent collisions when doing AX.25\n\t  networking.

Linux cannot yet act as a DAMA server.  This option\n\t  only compiles DAMA slave support into the kernel.  It still needs to\n\t  be explicitly enabled, so if unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig NETROM\n\ttristate \"Amateur Radio NET/ROM protocol\"\n\tdepends on AX25\n\thelp\n\t  NET/ROM is a network layer protocol on top of AX.25 useful for\n\t  routing.\n\n\t  A comprehensive listing of all the software for Linux amateur radio\n\t  users as well as information about how to configure an AX.25 port is\n\t  contained in the Linux Ham Wiki, available from\n\t  <https://linux-ax25.in-berlin.de>.
