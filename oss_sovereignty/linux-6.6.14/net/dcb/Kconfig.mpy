Say 'Y'\n\t  if you have a DCB capable Ethernet adapter which supports this\n\t  interface and you are connected to a DCB capable switch.\n\n\t  DCB is a collection of Ethernet enhancements which allow DCB capable\n\t  NICs and switches to support network traffic with differing\n\t  requirements (highly reliable, no drops vs. best effort vs. low\n\t  latency) to co-exist on Ethernet.\n\n\t  DCB features include:\n\t    Enhanced Transmission Selection (aka Priority Grouping) - provides a\n\t      framework for assigning bandwidth guarantees to traffic classes.\n\t    Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) - a MAC control pause frame which\n\t      works at the granularity of the 802.1p priority instead of the\n\t      link (802.3x).\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n",
