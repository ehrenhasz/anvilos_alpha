However, note that in order to not create daisy chain\n\t scenarios, this relaxation is not allowed in cases where the BSS client\n\t is associated to P2P GO and in addition the P2P GO instantiated on\n\t a channel due to this relaxation should not allow connection from\n\t non P2P clients.\n\n\t The regulatory core will apply these relaxations only for drivers that\n\t support this feature by declaring the appropriate channel flags and\n\t capabilities in their registration flow.\n\nconfig CFG80211_DEFAULT_PS\n\tbool \"enable powersave by default\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  This option enables powersave mode by default.\n\n\t  If this causes your applications to misbehave you should fix your\n\t  applications instead -- they need to register their network\n\t  latency requirement, see Documentation/power/pm_qos_interface.rst.\n\nconfig CFG80211_DEBUGFS\n\tbool \"cfg80211 DebugFS entries\"\n\tdepends on DEBUG_FS\n\thelp\n\t  You can enable this if you want debugfs entries for cfg80211.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig CFG80211_CRDA_SUPPORT\n\tbool \"support CRDA\" if EXPERT\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  You should enable this option unless you know for sure you have no\n\t  need for it, for example when using the regulatory database loaded as\n\t  a firmware file.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig CFG80211_WEXT\n\tbool \"cfg80211 wireless extensions compatibility\" if !CFG80211_WEXT_EXPORT\n\tselect WEXT_CORE\n\tdefault y if CFG80211_WEXT_EXPORT\n\thelp\n\t  Enable this option if you need old userspace for wireless\n\t  extensions with cfg80211-based drivers.\n\nconfig CFG80211_WEXT_EXPORT\n\tbool\n\thelp\n\t  Drivers should select this option if they require cfg80211's\n\t  wext compatibility symbols to be exported.\n\nendif # CFG80211\n\nconfig LIB80211\n\ttristate\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  This options enables a library of common routines used\n\t  by IEEE802.11 wireless LAN drivers.\n\n\t  Drivers should select this themselves if needed.\n\nconfig LIB80211_CRYPT_WEP\n\ttristate\n\tselect CRYPTO_LIB_ARC4\n\nconfig LIB80211_CRYPT_CCMP\n\ttristate\n\tselect CRYPTO\n\tselect CRYPTO_AES\n\tselect CRYPTO_CCM\n\nconfig LIB80211_CRYPT_TKIP\n\ttristate\n\tselect CRYPTO_LIB_ARC4\n\nconfig LIB80211_DEBUG\n\tbool \"lib80211 debugging messages\"\n\tdepends on LIB80211\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  You can enable this if you want verbose debugging messages\n\t  from lib80211.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n",
