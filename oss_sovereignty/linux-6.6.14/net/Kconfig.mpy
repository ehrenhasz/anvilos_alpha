The tools are\n\t  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number\n\t  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.\n\n\t  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly\n\t  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from\n\t  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.\n\nif NET\n\nconfig WANT_COMPAT_NETLINK_MESSAGES\n\tbool\n\thelp\n\t  This option can be selected by other options that need compat\n\t  netlink messages.\n\nconfig COMPAT_NETLINK_MESSAGES\n\tdef_bool y\n\tdepends on COMPAT\n\tdepends on WEXT_CORE || WANT_COMPAT_NETLINK_MESSAGES\n\thelp\n\t  This option makes it possible to send different netlink messages\n\t  to tasks depending on whether the task is a compat task or not.

It is highly recommended to say Y here (this will enlarge\n\t  your kernel by about 400 KB), since some programs (e.g. the X window\n\t  system) use TCP/IP even if your machine is not connected to any\n\t  other computer.

This option adds some overhead in the transmit\n\t  and receive paths.\n\n\t  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.\n\nmenuconfig NETFILTER\n\tbool \"Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)\"\n\thelp\n\t  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets\n\t  that pass through your Linux box.\n\n\t  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as\n\t  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of\n\t  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a \"packet\n\t  filter\", which means that it can reject individual network packets\n\t  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,\n\t  a \"proxy-based\" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more\n\t  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more\n\t  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level\n\t  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based\n\t  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local\n\t  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but\n\t  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if\n\t  you say Y here.\n\n\t  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as\n\t  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without\n\t  globally valid IP addresses. This is called \"masquerading\": if one\n\t  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to\n\t  the outside, your box can \"masquerade\" as that computer, i.e. it\n\t  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but\n\t  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the\n\t  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host\n\t  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the\n\t  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net\n\t  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can\n\t  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to\n\t  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network\n\t  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often\n\t  called NAT (Network Address Translation).\n\n\t  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on\n\t  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux\n\t  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,\n\t  typically a caching proxy server.\n\n\t  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using\n\t  a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables \"see\"\n\t  the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet\n\t  protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter\n\t  configuration).\n\n\t  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous\n\t  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent\n\t  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see\n\t  <file:Documentation/Changes> under \"iptables\" for the location of\n\t  these packages.\n\nif NETFILTER\n\nconfig NETFILTER_ADVANCED\n\tbool \"Advanced netfilter configuration\"\n\tdepends on NETFILTER\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here you can select between all the netfilter modules.\n\t  If you say N the more unusual ones will not be shown and the\n\t  basic ones needed by most people will default to 'M'.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig BRIDGE_NETFILTER\n\ttristate \"Bridged IP/ARP packets filtering\"\n\tdepends on BRIDGE\n\tdepends on NETFILTER && INET\n\tdepends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED\n\tselect NETFILTER_FAMILY_BRIDGE\n\tselect SKB_EXTENSIONS\n\thelp\n\t  Enabling this option will let arptables resp. iptables see bridged\n\t  ARP resp.
