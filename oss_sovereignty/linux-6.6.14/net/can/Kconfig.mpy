Development of the CAN bus started in\n\t  1983 at Robert Bosch GmbH, and the protocol was officially\n\t  released in 1986. The CAN bus was originally mainly for automotive,\n\t  but is now widely used in marine (NMEA2000), industrial, and medical\n\t  applications. More information on the CAN network protocol family\n\t  PF_CAN is contained in <Documentation/networking/can.rst>.\n\n\t  If you want CAN support you should say Y here and also to the\n\t  specific driver for your controller(s) under the Network device\n\t  support section.\n\nif CAN\n\nconfig CAN_RAW\n\ttristate \"Raw CAN Protocol (raw access with CAN-ID filtering)\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  The raw CAN protocol option offers access to the CAN bus via\n\t  the BSD socket API. You probably want to use the raw socket in\n\t  most cases where no higher level protocol is being used. The raw\n\t  socket has several filter options e.g. ID masking / error frames.\n\t  To receive/send raw CAN messages, use AF_CAN with protocol CAN_RAW.\n\nconfig CAN_BCM\n\ttristate \"Broadcast Manager CAN Protocol (with content filtering)\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  The Broadcast Manager offers content filtering, timeout monitoring,\n\t  sending of RTR frames, and cyclic CAN messages without permanent user\n\t  interaction. The BCM can be 'programmed' via the BSD socket API and\n\t  informs you on demand e.g. only on content updates / timeouts.\n\t  You probably want to use the bcm socket in most cases where cyclic\n\t  CAN messages are used on the bus (e.g. in automotive environments).\n\t  To use the Broadcast Manager, use AF_CAN with protocol CAN_BCM.\n\nconfig CAN_GW\n\ttristate \"CAN Gateway/Router (with netlink configuration)\"\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  The CAN Gateway/Router is used to route (and modify) CAN frames.\n\t  It is based on the PF_CAN core infrastructure for msg filtering and\n\t  msg sending and can optionally modify routed CAN frames on the fly.\n\t  CAN frames can be routed between CAN network interfaces (one hop).\n\t  They can be modified with AND/OR/XOR/SET operations as configured\n\t  by the netlink configuration interface known e.g. from iptables.\n\nsource \"net/can/j1939/Kconfig\"\n\nconfig CAN_ISOTP\n\ttristate \"ISO 15765-2:2016 CAN transport protocol\"\n\thelp\n\t  CAN Transport Protocols offer support for segmented Point-to-Point\n\t  communication between CAN nodes via two defined CAN Identifiers.\n\t  As CAN frames can only transport a small amount of data bytes\n\t  (max. 8 bytes for 'classic' CAN and max. 64 bytes for CAN FD) this\n\t  segmentation is needed to transport longer Protocol Data Units (PDU)\n\t  as needed e.g. for vehicle diagnosis (UDS, ISO 14229) or IP-over-CAN\n\t  traffic.\n\t  This protocol driver implements data transfers according to\n\t  ISO 15765-2:2016 for 'classic' CAN and CAN FD frame types.\n\t  If you want to perform automotive vehicle diagnostic services (UDS),\n\t  say 'y'.\n\nendif\n",
