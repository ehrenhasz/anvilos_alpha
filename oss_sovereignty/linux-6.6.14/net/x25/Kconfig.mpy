Governments, banks, and other organizations tend to use it\n\t  to connect to each other or to form Wide Area Networks (WANs). Many\n\t  countries have public X.25 networks. X.25 consists of two\n\t  protocols: the higher level Packet Layer Protocol (PLP) (say Y here\n\t  if you want that) and the lower level data link layer protocol LAPB\n\t  (say Y to \"LAPB Data Link Driver\" below if you want that).\n\n\t  You can read more about X.25 at <https://www.sangoma.com/tutorials/x25/> and\n\t  <http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/X.25>.\n\t  Information about X.25 for Linux is contained in the files\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/x25.rst> and\n\t  <file:Documentation/networking/x25-iface.rst>.\n\n\t  One connects to an X.25 network either with a dedicated network card\n\t  using the X.21 protocol (not yet supported by Linux) or one can do\n\t  X.25 over a standard telephone line using an ordinary modem (say Y\n\t  to \"X.25 async driver\" below) or over Ethernet using an ordinary\n\t  Ethernet card and the LAPB over Ethernet (say Y to \"LAPB Data Link\n\t  Driver\" and \"LAPB over Ethernet driver\" below).\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called x25. If unsure, say N.\n",
