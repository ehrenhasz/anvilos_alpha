For this to work, your Linux box\n\t  needs (at least) two physical Ethernet interfaces.\n\n\t  For DANH, it must be connected as a node in a ring network together\n\t  with other HSR capable nodes. All Ethernet frames sent over the HSR\n\t  device will be sent in both directions on the ring (over both slave\n\t  ports), giving a redundant, instant fail-over network. Each HSR node\n\t  in the ring acts like a bridge for HSR frames, but filters frames\n\t  that have been forwarded earlier.\n\n\t  For DANP, it must be connected as a node connecting to two\n\t  separate networks over the two slave interfaces. Like HSR, Ethernet\n\t  frames sent over the PRP device will be sent to both networks giving\n\t  a redundant, instant fail-over network. Unlike HSR, PRP networks\n\t  can have Singly Attached Nodes (SAN) such as PC, printer, bridges\n\t  etc and will be able to communicate with DANP nodes.\n\n\t  This code is a \"best effort\" to comply with the HSR standard as\n\t  described in IEC 62439-3:2010 (HSRv0) and IEC 62439-3:2012 (HSRv1),\n\t  and PRP standard described in IEC 62439-4:2012 (PRP), but no\n\t  compliancy tests have been made. Use iproute2 to select the protocol\n\t  you would like to use.\n\n\t  You need to perform any and all necessary tests yourself before\n\t  relying on this code in a safety critical system!\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n",
