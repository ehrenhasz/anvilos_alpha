Please read the Bridge mini-HOWTO for more\n\t  information.\n\n\t  If you enable iptables support along with the bridge support then you\n\t  turn your bridge into a bridging IP firewall.\n\t  iptables will then see the IP packets being bridged, so you need to\n\t  take this into account when setting up your firewall rules.\n\t  Enabling arptables support when bridging will let arptables see\n\t  bridged ARP traffic in the arptables FORWARD chain.\n\n\t  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module\n\t  will be called bridge.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig BRIDGE_IGMP_SNOOPING\n\tbool \"IGMP/MLD snooping\"\n\tdepends on BRIDGE\n\tdepends on INET\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, then the Ethernet bridge will be able selectively\n\t  forward multicast traffic based on IGMP/MLD traffic received from\n\t  each port.\n\n\t  Say N to exclude this support and reduce the binary size.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING\n\tbool \"VLAN filtering\"\n\tdepends on BRIDGE\n\tdepends on VLAN_8021Q\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, then the Ethernet bridge will be able selectively\n\t  receive and forward traffic based on VLAN information in the packet\n\t  any VLAN information configured on the bridge port or bridge device.\n\n\t  Say N to exclude this support and reduce the binary size.\n\n\t  If unsure, say Y.\n\nconfig BRIDGE_MRP\n\tbool \"MRP protocol\"\n\tdepends on BRIDGE\n\tdefault n\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, then the Ethernet bridge will be able to run MRP\n\t  protocol to detect loops\n\n\t  Say N to exclude this support and reduce the binary size.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig BRIDGE_CFM\n\tbool \"CFM protocol\"\n\tdepends on BRIDGE\n\thelp\n\t  If you say Y here, then the Ethernet bridge will be able to run CFM\n\t  protocol according to 802.1Q section 12.14\n\n\t  Say N to exclude this support and reduce the binary size.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n",
