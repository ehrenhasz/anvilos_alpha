One IP tunnel may carry thousands of individual PPP\n\t  connections. L2TP is also used as a VPN protocol, popular\n\t  with home workers to connect to their offices.\n\n\t  L2TPv3 allows other protocols as well as PPP to be carried\n\t  over L2TP tunnels. L2TPv3 is defined in RFC 3931\n\t  <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3931.txt>.\n\n\t  The kernel component handles only L2TP data packets: a\n\t  userland daemon handles L2TP the control protocol (tunnel\n\t  and session setup). One such daemon is OpenL2TP\n\t  (http://openl2tp.org/).\n\n\t  If you don't need L2TP, say N. To compile all L2TP code as\n\t  modules, choose M here.\n\nconfig L2TP_DEBUGFS\n\ttristate \"L2TP debugfs support\"\n\tdepends on L2TP && DEBUG_FS\n\thelp\n\t  Support for l2tp directory in debugfs filesystem.

The module\n\t  will be called l2tp_debugfs.\n\nconfig L2TP_V3\n\tbool \"L2TPv3 support\"\n\tdepends on L2TP\n\thelp\n\t  Layer Two Tunneling Protocol Version 3\n\n\t  From RFC 3931 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3931.txt>.\n\n\t  The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a dynamic\n\t  mechanism for tunneling Layer 2 (L2) \"circuits\" across a\n\t  packet-oriented data network (e.g., over IP).  L2TP, as\n\t  originally defined in RFC 2661, is a standard method for\n\t  tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] sessions.\n\t  L2TP has since been adopted for tunneling a number of other\n\t  L2 protocols, including ATM, Frame Relay, HDLC and even raw\n\t  ethernet frames.\n\n\t  If you are connecting to L2TPv3 equipment, or you want to\n\t  tunnel raw ethernet frames using L2TP, say Y here. If\n\t  unsure, say N.\n\nconfig L2TP_IP\n\ttristate \"L2TP IP encapsulation for L2TPv3\"\n\tdepends on L2TP_V3\n\thelp\n\t  Support for L2TP-over-IP socket family.\n\n\t  The L2TPv3 protocol defines two possible encapsulations for\n\t  L2TP frames, namely UDP and plain IP (without UDP). This\n\t  driver provides a new L2TPIP socket family with which\n\t  userspace L2TPv3 daemons may create L2TP/IP tunnel sockets\n\t  when UDP encapsulation is not required. When L2TP is carried\n\t  in IP packets, it used IP protocol number 115, so this port\n\t  must be enabled in firewalls.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module\n\t  will be called l2tp_ip.\n\nconfig L2TP_ETH\n\ttristate \"L2TP ethernet pseudowire support for L2TPv3\"\n\tdepends on L2TP_V3\n\thelp\n\t  Support for carrying raw ethernet frames over L2TPv3.\n\n\t  From RFC 4719 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4719.txt>.\n\n\t  The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3 (L2TPv3) can be\n\t  used as a control protocol and for data encapsulation to set\n\t  up Pseudowires for transporting layer 2 Packet Data Units\n\t  across an IP network [RFC3931].\n\n\t  This driver provides an ethernet virtual interface for each\n\t  L2TP ethernet pseudowire instance. Standard Linux tools may\n\t  be used to assign an IP address to the local virtual\n\t  interface, or add the interface to a bridge.\n\n\t  If you are using L2TPv3, you will almost certainly want to\n\t  enable this option.\n\n\t  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module\n\t  will be called l2tp_eth.\n",
