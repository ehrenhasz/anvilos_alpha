AIX actually uses a Logical Volume Manager, where\n\t  \"logical volumes\" can be spread across one or multiple disks,\n\t  but this driver works only for the simple case of partitions which\n\t  are contiguous.\n\t  Otherwise, say N.\n\nconfig OSF_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Alpha OSF partition support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y if ALPHA\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which\n\t  were partitioned on an Alpha machine.\n\nconfig AMIGA_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Amiga partition table support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y if (AMIGA || AFFS_FS=y)\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which\n\t  were partitioned under AmigaOS.\n\nconfig ATARI_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Atari partition table support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y if ATARI\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which\n\t  were partitioned under the Atari OS.\n\nconfig IBM_PARTITION\n\tbool \"IBM disk label and partition support\"\n\tdepends on PARTITION_ADVANCED && S390\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to be able to read the hard disk\n\t  partition table format used by IBM DASD disks operating under CMS.\n\t  Otherwise, say N.\n\nconfig MAC_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Macintosh partition map support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y if (MAC || PPC_PMAC)\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which\n\t  were partitioned on a Macintosh.\n\nconfig MSDOS_PARTITION\n\tbool \"PC BIOS (MSDOS partition tables) support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here.\n\nconfig BSD_DISKLABEL\n\tbool \"BSD disklabel (FreeBSD partition tables) support\"\n\tdepends on PARTITION_ADVANCED && MSDOS_PARTITION\n\thelp\n\t  FreeBSD uses its own hard disk partition scheme on your PC. It\n\t  requires only one entry in the primary partition table of your disk\n\t  and manages it similarly to DOS extended partitions, putting in its\n\t  first sector a new partition table in BSD disklabel format. Saying Y\n\t  here allows you to read these disklabels and further mount FreeBSD\n\t  partitions from within Linux if you have also said Y to \"UFS\n\t  file system support\", above.

Its format is\n\t  incompatible with all other OSes. Saying Y here allows you to read\n\t  VTOC and further mount UnixWare partitions read-only from within\n\t  Linux if you have also said Y to \"UFS file system support\" or\n\t  \"System V and Coherent file system support\", above.\n\n\t  This is mainly used to carry data from a UnixWare box to your\n\t  Linux box via a removable medium like magneto-optical, ZIP or\n\t  removable IDE drives. Note, however, that a good portable way to\n\t  transport files and directories between unixes (and even other\n\t  operating systems) is given by the tar program (\"man tar\" or\n\t  preferably \"info tar\").\n\n\t  If you don't know what all this is about, say N.\n\nconfig LDM_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Windows Logical Disk Manager (Dynamic Disk) support\"\n\tdepends on PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which\n\t  were partitioned using Windows 2000's/XP's or Vista's Logical Disk\n\t  Manager.  They are also known as \"Dynamic Disks\".\n\n\t  Note this driver only supports Dynamic Disks with a protective MBR\n\t  label, i.e. DOS partition table.  It does not support GPT labelled\n\t  Dynamic Disks yet as can be created with Vista.\n\n\t  Windows 2000 introduced the concept of Dynamic Disks to get around\n\t  the limitations of the PC's partitioning scheme.  The Logical Disk\n\t  Manager allows the user to repartition a disk and create spanned,\n\t  mirrored, striped or RAID volumes, all without the need for\n\t  rebooting.\n\n\t  Normal partitions are now called Basic Disks under Windows 2000, XP,\n\t  and Vista.\n\n\t  For a fuller description read <file:Documentation/admin-guide/ldm.rst>.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig LDM_DEBUG\n\tbool \"Windows LDM extra logging\"\n\tdepends on LDM_PARTITION\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like LDM to log verbosely.  This could be\n\t  helpful if the driver doesn't work as expected and you'd like to\n\t  report a bug.\n\n\t  If unsure, say N.\n\nconfig SGI_PARTITION\n\tbool \"SGI partition support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y if DEFAULT_SGI_PARTITION\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to be able to read the hard disk\n\t  partition table format used by SGI machines.\n\nconfig ULTRIX_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Ultrix partition table support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y if MACH_DECSTATION\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to be able to read the hard disk\n\t  partition table format used by DEC (now Compaq) Ultrix machines.\n\t  Otherwise, say N.\n\nconfig SUN_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Sun partition tables support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y if (SPARC || SUN3 || SUN3X)\n\thelp\n\t  Like most systems, SunOS uses its own hard disk partition table\n\t  format, incompatible with all others. Saying Y here allows you to\n\t  read these partition tables and further mount SunOS partitions from\n\t  within Linux if you have also said Y to \"UFS file system support\",\n\t  above. This is mainly used to carry data from a SPARC under SunOS to\n\t  your Linux box via a removable medium like magneto-optical or ZIP\n\t  drives; note however that a good portable way to transport files and\n\t  directories between unixes (and even other operating systems) is\n\t  given by the tar program (\"man tar\" or preferably \"info tar\"). If\n\t  you don't know what all this is about, say N.\n\nconfig KARMA_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Karma Partition support\"\n\tdepends on PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to mount the Rio Karma MP3 player, as it\n\t  uses a proprietary partition table.\n\nconfig EFI_PARTITION\n\tbool \"EFI GUID Partition support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y\n\tselect CRC32\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to use hard disks under Linux which\n\t  were partitioned using EFI GPT.\n\nconfig SYSV68_PARTITION\n\tbool \"SYSV68 partition table support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\tdefault y if VME\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you would like to be able to read the hard disk\n\t  partition table format used by Motorola Delta machines (using\n\t  sysv68).\n\t  Otherwise, say N.\n\nconfig CMDLINE_PARTITION\n\tbool \"Command line partition support\" if PARTITION_ADVANCED\n\thelp\n\t  Say Y here if you want to read the partition table from bootargs.\n\t  The format for the command line is just like mtdparts.\n\nendmenu\n",
