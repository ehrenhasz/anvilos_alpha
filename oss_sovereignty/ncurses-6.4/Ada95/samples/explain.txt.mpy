The main intention of the demo is not to demonstrate or\ntest all the features of ncurses and its subsystems, but to provide\nto you some sample code how to use the binding with Ada95.\n\nYou may select this options:\n\n   * Look at some ncurses core functions\n   * Look at some features of the menu subsystem\n   * Look at some features of the form subsystem\n   * Look at the output of the Ada.Text_IO like functions\n     for ncurses.\n\n#MAINPAD\nYou may press at any place in this demo CTRL-C. This will give you a command\nwindow. You can just type in the Label-String of a function key, then this\nkey will be simulated. This should help you to run the application even if\nyou run it on a terminal with no or only a few function keys. With CTRL-N\nand CTRL-P you may browse through the possible values in the command window.\n#MENU00\nHere we give you a selection of various menu demonstrations.\n#MENU-PAD00\nThis menu itself is a demo for a single valued, 1-column menu with\ndescriptions for the items, a marker and a padding character between\nthe item name and the description.\n#MENU01\nThis is a demo of the some of the menu layout options. One of them\nis the spacing functionality. Just press the Key labeled \"Flip\" to\nflip between the non-spaced and a spaced version of the menu. Please\nnote that this functionality is unique for ncurses and is not found\nin the SVr4 menu implementation.\n\nThis is a menu that sometimes does not fit into its window and\ntherefore it becomes a scroll menu.\n\nYou can also see here very nicely the pattern matching functionality\nof menus. Type for example a 'J' and you will be positioned to the\nnext item after the current starting with a 'J'. Any more characters\nyou type in make the pattern more specific. With CTRL-A and CTRL-Z\n(for more details press the Key labeled \"Keys\") you can browse\nthrough all the items matching the pattern.\n\nYou may change the format of the menu. Just press one of the keys\nlabeled \"4x1\", \"4x2\" or \"4x3\" to get a menu with that many rows\nand columns.\n\nWith the Keys \"O-Row\" or \"O-Col\" (they occupy the same label and\nswitch on selection) you can change the major order scheme for\nthe menu. If \"O-Col\" is visible, the menu is currently major\nordered by rows, you can switch to major column order by pressing\nthe key. If \"O-Row\" is visible, it is just the reverse situation.\nThis Key is not visible in \"4x1\" layout mode, because in this case\nthe functionality makes no sense.\n\nWith the Keys \"Multi\" or \"Singl\" (they occupy the same label and\nswitch on selection) you can change whether or not the menu allows\nmultiple or only single selection.\n\nWith the Keys \"+Desc\" or \"-Desc\" (they occupy the same label and\nswitch on selection) you can change whether or not the descriptions\nfor each item should be displayed. Please not that this key is\nnot visible in the \"4x3\" layout mode, because in this case the\nmenu would not fit on a typical 80x24 screen.\n\nWith the Keys \"Disab\" or \"Enab\" (they occupy the same label and\nswitch on selection) you can dis- or enable the selectability of\nthe month with 31 days.\n#MENU-PAD01\nYou may press \"Flip\" to see the effect of ncurses unique menu-spacing.\nThe Keys \"4x1\", \"4x2\" and \"4x3\" will change the format of the menu.\nPlease note that this is a scrolling menu. You may also play with the\npattern matching functionality or try to change the format of the menu.\nFor more details press the Key labeled \"Help\".\n#FORM00\nThis is a demo of the forms package.\n#FORM-PAD00\nPlease note that this demo is far from being complete. It really shows\nonly a small part of the functionality of the forms package. Let's hope\nthe next version will have a richer demo (You want to contribute ?).\n#NOTIMPL\nSorry this functionality of the demo is not implemented at the moment.\nRemember this is a freeware project, so I can use only my very rare\nfree time to continue coding. If you would like to contribute, you\nare very welcome !\n#CURSES00\nThis is a menu where you can select some different demos of the ncurses\nfunctionality.\n#CURSES-PAD00\nPlease note that this demo is far from being complete. It really shows\nonly a small part of the functionality of the curses package. Let's hope\nthe next version will have a richer demo (You want to contribute ?).\n#MOUSEKEYS\nIn this demo you may use this keys:\n\n   - Key labeled \"Help\"  to get a help\n   - Key labeled \"Keys\"  is what you are reading now\n   - Key labeled \"Quit\"  to leave the demo\n\nYou may click the mouse buttons at any location at the screen and look\nat the protocol window !\n#MOUSE00\nA rather simple use of a mouse as demo. It is there just to test the\ncode and to provide the sample source.\n\nIt might be of interest, that the output into the protocol window is\ndone by the (n)curses Text_IO subpackages. Especially the output of\nthe button and state names is done by Ads's enumeration IO, which\nallows you to print the names of enumeration literals. That's really\nnice.\n#MOUSE-PAD00\nThis is a very simple demo of the mouse features of ncurses. It is there\njust to test whether or not the generated code for the binding really\nworks on the different architectures (seems so).\n#ATTRIBDEMO\nAgain this is a more than simple demo and just here to give you the\nsourcecode.\n#ATTRIBKEYS\nYou may press one of the three well known standard keys of this demo.\n#ATTRIB-PAD00\nAgain this is a more than simple demo and just here to give you the\nsource code. Feel free to contribute more.\n#TEXTIO\n#TEXTIOKEYS\n#TEXTIO-PAD00\n#END\n",
