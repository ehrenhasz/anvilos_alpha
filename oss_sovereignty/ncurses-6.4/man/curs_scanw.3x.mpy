NAME\n\\fBscanw\\fP,\n\\fBwscanw\\fP,\n\\fBmvscanw\\fP,\n\\fBmvwscanw\\fP,\n\\fBvwscanw\\fP, \\fBvw_scanw\\fP \\- convert formatted input from a \\fBcurses\\fP window\n.SH SYNOPSIS\n\\fB#include

\\fBscanw\\fP, \\fBwscanw\\fP and \\fBmvscanw\\fP routines are analogous to\n\\fBscanf\\fP [see \\fBscanf\\fP(3)].\nThe effect of these routines is as though\n\\fBwgetstr\\fP were called on the window, and the resulting line used as input\nfor \\fBsscanf\\fP(3).\nFields which do not map to a variable in the \\fIfmt\\fP\nfield are lost.\n.PP\nThe \\fBvwscanw\\fP and \\fBvw_scanw\\fP routines are analogous to \\fBvscanf\\fP(3).\nThey perform a \\fBwscanw\\fP using a variable argument list.\nThe third argument is a \\fBva_list\\fP,\na pointer to a list of arguments, as defined in \\fB<stdarg.h>\\fP.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\n\\fBvwscanw\\fP returns \\fBERR\\fP on failure and an integer equal to the\nnumber of fields scanned on success.\n.PP\nApplications may use the return value from the \\fBscanw\\fP, \\fBwscanw\\fP,\n\\fBmvscanw\\fP and \\fBmvwscanw\\fP routines to determine the number of fields\nwhich were mapped in the call.\n.PP\nFunctions with a \\*(``mv\\*('' prefix first perform a cursor movement using\n\\fBwmove\\fP, and return an error if the position is outside the window,\nor if the window pointer is null.\n.SH HISTORY\nWhile \\fBscanw\\fP was implemented in 4BSD,\nnone of the BSD releases used it until 4.4BSD (in a game).\nThat early version of curses was before the ANSI C standard.\nIt did not use <varargs.h>, though that was available.\nIn 1991 (a couple of years after SVr4 was generally available,\nand after the C standard was published),\nother developers updated the library,\nusing <stdarg.h> internally in 4.4BSD curses.\nEven with this improvement,\nBSD curses did not use function prototypes (or even declare\nfunctions) in the <curses.h> header until 1992.\n.PP\nSVr2 documented\n\\fBscanw\\fP,\n\\fBwscanw\\fP\ntersely as \\*(``scanf through \\fIstdscr\\fP\\*('' and\ntersely as \\*(``scanf through \\fIwin\\fP\\*('', respectively.\n.PP\nSVr3 added\n\\fBmvscanw\\fP, and\n\\fBmvwscanw\\fP, with a three-line summary saying that they were analogous\nto \\fBscanf\\fP(3),\nexplaining that the string which would be output from \\fBscanf\\fP(3) would\ninstead be output using \\fBwaddstr\\fP on the given window.\nSVr3 also added \\fBvwscanw\\fP, saying that the third parameter\nis a \\fBva_list\\fP, defined in <varargs.h>,\nand referring the reader to the manual pages for \\fIvarargs\\fP and\n\\fBvprintf\\fP for detailed descriptions.\n(Because the SVr3 documentation does not mention \\fBvscanf\\fP,\nthat reference to \\fBvprintf\\fP may not be an error).\n.PP\nSVr4 added no new variations of \\fBscanw\\fP,\nbut provided for using <varargs.h> or <stdarg.h> to define the \\fBva_list\\fP\ntype.\n.PP\nX/Open Curses added \\fBvw_scanw\\fP to replace \\fBvwscanw\\fP,\nstating that its \\fBva_list\\fP definition requires <stdarg.h>.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nIn this implementation, \\fBvw_scanw\\fP and \\fBvwscanw\\fP are equivalent,\nto support legacy applications.\nHowever, the latter (\\fBvwscanw\\fP) is obsolete:\n.bP\nThe XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 described these functions,\nnoting that the function\n\\fBvwscanw\\fP is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced by a function\n\\fBvw_scanw\\fP using the \\fB<stdarg.h>\\fP interface.\n.bP\nThe Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that\n\\fBvw_scanw\\fP  is preferred to \\fBvwscanw\\fP since the latter requires\nincluding \\fB<varargs.h>\\fP, which\ncannot be used in the same file as \\fB<stdarg.h>\\fP.\nThis implementation uses \\fB<stdarg.h>\\fP for both, because that header\nis included in \\fB<curses.h\\fP>.\n.bP\nX/Open Curses, Issue 5 (December 2007) marked \\fBvwscanw\\fP (along with\n\\fBvwprintw\\fP and the termcap interface) as withdrawn.\n.LP\nBoth XSI and The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 state that these\nfunctions return \\fBERR\\fP or \\fBOK\\fP.\n.bP\nSince the underlying \\fBscanf\\fP(3) can return the number of items scanned,\nand the SVr4 code was documented to use this feature,\nthis is probably an editing error which was introduced in XSI,\nrather than being done intentionally.\n.bP\nThis implementation returns the number of items scanned,\nfor compatibility with SVr4 curses.\nAs of 2018, NetBSD curses also returns the number of items scanned.\nBoth ncurses and NetBSD curses call \\fBvsscanf\\fP to scan the string,\nwhich returns \\fBEOF\\fP on error.\n.bP\nPortable applications should only test if the return value is \\fBERR\\fP,\nsince the \\fBOK\\fP value (zero) is likely to be misleading.\n.IP\nOne possible way to get useful results would be to use a \"%n\" conversion\nat the end of the format string to ensure that something was processed.\n.SH SEE
