\\fIvarglist\\fB);\\fR\n.SH DESCRIPTION\nThe \\fBprintw\\fP, \\fBwprintw\\fP, \\fBmvprintw\\fP and \\fBmvwprintw\\fP\nroutines are analogous to \\fBprintf\\fP [see \\fBprintf\\fP(3)].\nIn\neffect, the string that would be output by \\fBprintf\\fP is output\ninstead as though \\fBwaddstr\\fP were used on the given window.\n.PP\nThe \\fBvwprintw\\fP and \\fBvw_printw\\fP routines are analogous\nto \\fBvprintf\\fP [see \\fBprintf\\fP(3)]\nand perform a \\fBwprintw\\fP using a variable argument list.\nThe third argument is a \\fBva_list\\fP, a pointer to a\nlist of arguments, as defined in \\fB<stdarg.h>\\fP.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nRoutines that return an integer return \\fBERR\\fP upon failure and \\fBOK\\fP\n(SVr4 only specifies \"an integer value other than \\fBERR\\fP\") upon successful\ncompletion.\n.PP\nX/Open defines no error conditions.\nIn this implementation,\nan error may be returned if it cannot allocate enough memory for the\nbuffer used to format the results.\nIt will return an error if the window pointer is null.\n.PP\nFunctions with a \\*(``mv\\*('' prefix first perform a cursor movement using\n\\fBwmove\\fP, and return an error if the position is outside the window,\nor if the window pointer is null.\n.SH HISTORY\nWhile \\fBprintw\\fP was implemented in 4BSD,\nit was unused until 4.2BSD (which used it in games).\nThat early version of curses was before the ANSI C standard.\nIt did not use <varargs.h>, though that was available.\nIn 1991 (a couple of years after SVr4 was generally available,\nand after the C standard was published),\nother developers updated the library,\nusing <stdarg.h> internally in 4.4BSD curses.\nEven with this improvement,\nBSD curses did not use function prototypes (or even declare\nfunctions) in the <curses.h> header until 1992.\n.PP\nSVr2 documented\n\\fBprintw\\fP,\n\\fBwprintw\\fP\ntersely as \\*(``printf on \\fIstdscr\\fP\\*('' and\ntersely as \\*(``printf on \\fIwin\\fP\\*('', respectively.\n.PP\nSVr3 added\n\\fBmvprintw\\fP, and\n\\fBmvwprintw\\fP, with a three-line summary saying that they were analogous\nto \\fBprintf\\fP(3),\nexplaining that the string which would be output from \\fBprintf\\fP(3) would\ninstead be output using \\fBwaddstr\\fP on the given window.\nSVr3 also added \\fBvwprintw\\fP, saying that the third parameter\nis a \\fBva_list\\fP, defined in <varargs.h>,\nand referring the reader to the manual pages for \\fIvarargs\\fP and\n\\fBvprintf\\fP for detailed descriptions.\n.PP\nSVr4 added no new variations of \\fBprintw\\fP,\nbut provided for using <varargs.h> or <stdarg.h> to define the \\fBva_list\\fP\ntype.\n.PP\nX/Open Curses added \\fBvw_printw\\fP to replace \\fBvwprintw\\fP,\nstating that its \\fBva_list\\fP definition requires <stdarg.h>.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nIn this implementation, \\fBvw_printw\\fP and \\fBvwprintw\\fP are equivalent,\nto support legacy applications.\nHowever, the latter (\\fBvwprintw\\fP) is obsolete:\n.bP\nThe XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 described these functions.\nThe function\n\\fBvwprintw\\fP is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced by a function\n\\fBvw_printw\\fP using the \\fB<stdarg.h>\\fP interface.\n.bP\nThe Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that\n\\fBvw_printw\\fP  is preferred to \\fBvwprintw\\fP since the latter requires\nincluding \\fB<varargs.h>\\fP, which\ncannot be used in the same file as \\fB<stdarg.h>\\fP.\nThis implementation uses \\fB<stdarg.h>\\fP for both,\nbecause that header is included in \\fB<curses.h\\fP>.\n.bP\nX/Open Curses, Issue 5 (December 2007) marked \\fBvwprintw\\fP (along with\n\\fBvwscanw\\fP and the termcap interface) as withdrawn.\n.SH SEE
