getcchar\n.PP\nThe \\fBgetcchar\\fP function gets a wide-character string\nand rendition from a \\fBcchar_t\\fP argument.\nWhen \\fIwch\\fP is not a null pointer,\nthe \\fBgetcchar\\fP function does the following:\n.bP\nExtracts information from a \\fBcchar_t\\fP value \\fIwcval\\fP\n.bP\nStores the character attributes in the location pointed to by \\fIattrs\\fP\n.bP\nStores the color-pair in the location pointed to by \\fIcolor_pair\\fP\n.bP\nStores the wide-character string,\ncharacters referenced by \\fIwcval\\fP, into the array pointed to by \\fIwch\\fP.\n.PP\nWhen\n\\fIwch\\fP\nis a null pointer, the\n\\fBgetcchar\\fP\nfunction does the following:\n.bP\nObtains the number of wide characters pointed to by \\fIwcval\\fP\n.bP\nDoes not change the data referenced by\n\\fIattrs\\fP\nor\n\\fIcolor_pair\\fP\n.SS setcchar\n.PP\nThe \\fBsetcchar\\fP function initializes the location pointed to by \\fIwcval\\fP\nby using:\n.bP\nThe character attributes in\n\\fIattrs\\fP\n.bP\nThe color pair in\n\\fIcolor_pair\\fP\n.bP\nThe wide-character string pointed to by \\fIwch\\fP.\nThe string must be L'\\\\0' terminated,\ncontain at most one spacing character,\nwhich must be the first.\n.IP\nUp to \\fBCCHARW_MAX\\fP\\-1 nonspacing characters may follow.\nAdditional nonspacing characters are ignored.\n.IP\nThe string may contain a single control character instead.\nIn that case, no nonspacing characters are allowed.\n.SH EXTENSIONS\n.PP\nX/Open Curses documents the \\fIopts\\fP argument as reserved for future use,\nsaying that it must be null.\nThis implementation\nuses that parameter in ABI 6 for the functions which have a color-pair\nparameter to support extended color pairs:\n.bP\nFor  functions  which modify the color, e.g., \\fBsetcchar\\fP,\nif \\fIopts\\fP is set it is treated as a pointer to \\fBint\\fP,\nand used to  set  the  color pair instead of the \\fBshort\\fP pair parameter.\n.bP\nFor functions which retrieve the color, e.g., \\fBgetcchar\\fP,\nif \\fIopts\\fP is set it is treated as a pointer to \\fBint\\fP,\nand  used  to  retrieve  the color pair as an \\fBint\\fP value,\nin addition retrieving it via the standard pointer to \\fBshort\\fP parameter.\n.SH NOTES\n.PP\nThe \\fIwcval\\fP argument may be a value generated by a call to\n\\fBsetcchar\\fP or by a function that has a \\fBcchar_t\\fP output argument.\nIf \\fIwcval\\fP is constructed by any other means, the effect is unspecified.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\n.PP\nWhen \\fIwch\\fP is a null pointer,\n\\fBgetcchar\\fP returns the number of wide characters referenced by\n\\fIwcval\\fP,\nincluding one for a trailing null.\n.PP\nWhen \\fIwch\\fP is not a null pointer,\n\\fBgetcchar\\fP returns \\fBOK\\fP upon successful completion,\nand \\fBERR\\fP otherwise.\n.PP\nUpon successful completion, \\fBsetcchar\\fP returns \\fBOK\\fP.\nOtherwise, it returns \\fBERR\\fP.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nThe \\fBCCHARW_MAX\\fP symbol is specific to ncurses.\nX/Open Curses does not provide details for the layout of the \\fBcchar_t\\fP\nstructure.\nIt tells what data are stored in it:\n.bP\na spacing character (\\fBwchar_t\\fP, i.e., 32-bits).\n.bP\nnon-spacing characters (again, \\fBwchar_t\\fP's).\n.bP\nattributes (at least 16 bits, inferred from the various ACS- and WACS-flags).\n.bP\ncolor pair (at least 16 bits, inferred from the \\fBunsigned short\\fP type).\n.PP\nThe non-spacing characters are optional,\nin the sense that zero or more may be stored in a \\fBcchar_t\\fP.\nXOpen/Curses specifies a limit:\n.RS 4\n.PP\nImplementations may limit the number of non-spacing characters that can be\nassociated with a spacing character, provided any limit is at least 5.\n.RE\n.PP\nThe Unix implementations at the time follow that limit:\n.bP\nAIX\\ 4 and OSF1\\ 4 use the same declaration with an array of 5 non-spacing\ncharacters \\fIz\\fP and a single spacing character \\fIc\\fP.\n.bP\nHP-UX\\ 10 uses an opaque structure with 28 bytes,\nwhich is large enough for the 6 \\fBwchar_t\\fP values.\n.bP\nSolaris \\fIxpg4\\fP curses uses a single array of 6 \\fBwchar_t\\fP values.\n.PP\nThis implementation's \\fBcchar_t\\fP was defined in 1995\nusing \\fB5\\fP for the total of spacing and non-spacing characters\n(\\fBCCHARW_MAX\\fP).\nThat was probably due to a misreading of the AIX\\ 4 header files,\nbecause the X/Open Curses document was not generally available at that time.\nLater (in 2002), this detail was overlooked when beginning to implement\nthe functions using the structure.\n.PP\nIn practice, even four non-spacing characters may seem enough.\nX/Open Curses documents possible uses for non-spacing characters,\nincluding using them for ligatures between characters\n(a feature apparently not supported by any curses implementation).\nUnicode does not limit the (analogous) number of combining characters,\nso some applications may be affected.\n.SH SEE
