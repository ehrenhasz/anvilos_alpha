should normally contain the type name of\nthe terminal, console or display-device type you are using.\nThis information\nis critical for all screen-oriented programs, including your editor and mailer.\n.PP\nA default \\fBTERM\\fP value will be set on a per-line basis by either\n\\fB/etc/inittab\\fP (e.g., System\\-V-like UNIXes)\nor \\fB/etc/ttys\\fP (BSD UNIXes).\nThis will nearly always suffice for workstation and microcomputer consoles.\n.PP\nIf you use a dialup line, the type of device attached to it may vary.\nOlder UNIX systems pre-set a very dumb terminal type\nlike \\*(``dumb\\*('' or \\*(``dialup\\*('' on dialup lines.\nNewer ones may pre-set \\*(``vt100\\*('', reflecting the prevalence of DEC\nVT100-compatible terminals and personal-computer emulators.\n.PP\nModern telnets pass your \\fBTERM\\fP environment variable from the local side to\nthe remote one.\nThere can be problems if the remote terminfo or termcap entry\nfor your type is not compatible with yours, but this situation is rare and\ncan almost always be avoided by explicitly exporting \\*(``vt100\\*(''\n(assuming you are in fact using a VT100-superset console,\nterminal, or terminal emulator).\n.PP\nIn any case, you are free to override the system \\fBTERM\\fP setting to your\ntaste in your shell profile.\nThe \\fB@TSET@\\fP(1) utility may be of assistance;\nyou can give it a set of rules for deducing or requesting a terminal type based\non the tty device and baud rate.\n.PP\nSetting your own \\fBTERM\\fP value may also be useful if you have created a\ncustom entry incorporating options (such as visual bell or reverse-video)\nwhich you wish to override the system default type for your line.\n.PP\nTerminal type descriptions are stored as files of capability data underneath\n\\*d.\nTo browse a list of all terminal names recognized by the system, do\n.sp\n\t@TOE@ | more\n.sp\nfrom your shell.\nThese capability files are in a binary format optimized for\nretrieval speed (unlike the old text-based \\fBtermcap\\fP format they replace);\nto examine an entry, you must use the \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP(1M) command.\nInvoke it as follows:\n.sp\n\t@INFOCMP@ \\fIentry_name\\fP\n.sp\nwhere \\fIentry_name\\fP is the name of the type you wish to examine (and the\nname of its capability file the subdirectory of \\*d named for its first\nletter).\nThis command dumps a capability file in the text format described by\n\\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n).\n.PP\nThe first line of a \\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n) description gives the names by which\nterminfo knows a terminal,\nseparated by \\*(``|\\*('' (pipe-bar) characters with the last\nname field terminated by a comma.\nThe first name field is the type's\n\\fIprimary name\\fP, and is the one to use when setting \\fBTERM\\fP.  The last\nname field (if distinct from the first) is actually a description of the\nterminal type (it may contain blanks; the others must be single words).\nName\nfields between the first and last (if present) are aliases for the terminal,\nusually historical names retained for compatibility.\n.PP\nThere are some conventions for how to choose terminal primary names that help\nkeep them informative and unique.\nHere is a step-by-step guide to naming\nterminals that also explains how to parse them:\n.PP\nFirst, choose a root name.\nThe root will consist of a lower-case letter\nfollowed by up to seven lower-case letters or digits.\nYou need to avoid using\npunctuation characters in root names, because they are used and interpreted as\nfilenames and shell meta-characters (such as !, $, *, ?, etc.) embedded in them\nmay cause odd and unhelpful behavior.\nThe slash (/), or any other character\nthat may be interpreted by anyone's file system (\\e, $, [, ]), is especially\ndangerous (terminfo is platform-independent, and choosing names with special\ncharacters could someday make life difficult for users of a future port).\nThe\ndot (.) character is relatively safe as long as there is at most one per root\nname; some historical terminfo names use it.\n.PP\nThe root name for a terminal or workstation console type should almost always\nbegin with a vendor prefix (such as \\fBhp\\fP for Hewlett-Packard, \\fBwy\\fP for\nWyse, or \\fBatt\\fP for AT&T terminals), or a common name of the terminal line\n(\\fBvt\\fP for the VT series of terminals from DEC, or \\fBsun\\fP for Sun\nMicrosystems workstation consoles, or \\fBregent\\fP for the ADDS Regent series.\nYou can list the terminfo tree to see what prefixes are already in common use.\nThe root name prefix should be followed when appropriate by a model number;\nthus \\fBvt100\\fP, \\fBhp2621\\fP, \\fBwy50\\fP.\n.PP\nThe root name for a PC-Unix console type should be the OS name,\ni.e., \\fBlinux\\fP, \\fBbsdos\\fP, \\fBfreebsd\\fP, \\fBnetbsd\\fP.  It should\n\\fInot\\fP be \\fBconsole\\fP or any other generic that might cause confusion in a\nmulti-platform environment!  If a model number follows, it should indicate\neither the OS release level or the console driver release level.\n.PP\nThe root name for a terminal emulator (assuming it does not fit one of the\nstandard ANSI or vt100 types) should be the program name or a readily\nrecognizable abbreviation of it (i.e., \\fBversaterm\\fP, \\fBctrm\\fP).\n.PP\nFollowing the root name, you may add any reasonable number of hyphen-separated\nfeature suffixes.\n.TP 5\n2p\nHas two pages of memory.\nLikewise 4p, 8p, etc.\n.TP 5\nmc\nMagic-cookie.\nSome terminals (notably older Wyses) can only support one\nattribute without magic-cookie lossage.\nTheir base entry is usually paired\nwith another that has this suffix and uses magic cookies to support multiple\nattributes.\n.TP 5\n\\-am\nEnable auto-margin (right-margin wraparound).\n.TP 5\n\\-m\nMono mode \\- suppress color support.\n.TP 5\n\\-na\nNo arrow keys \\- termcap ignores arrow keys which are actually there on the\nterminal, so the user can use the arrow keys locally.\n.TP 5\n\\-nam\nNo auto-margin \\- suppress am capability.\n.TP 5\n\\-nl\nNo labels \\- suppress soft labels.\n.TP 5\n\\-nsl\nNo status line \\- suppress status line.\n.TP 5\n\\-pp\nHas a printer port which is used.\n.TP 5\n\\-rv\nTerminal in reverse video mode (black on white).\n.TP 5\n\\-s\nEnable status line.\n.TP 5\n\\-vb\nUse visible bell (flash) rather than beep.\n.TP 5\n\\-w\nWide; terminal is in 132-column mode.\n.PP\nConventionally, if your terminal type is a variant intended to specify a\nline height, that suffix should go first.\nSo, for a hypothetical FuBarCo\nmodel 2317 terminal in 30-line mode with reverse video, best form would be\n\\fBfubar\\-30\\-rv\\fP (rather than, say, \\*(``fubar\\-rv\\-30\\*('').\n.PP\nTerminal types that are written not as standalone entries, but rather as\ncomponents to be plugged into other entries via \\fBuse\\fP capabilities,\nare distinguished by using embedded plus signs rather than dashes.\n.PP\nCommands which use a terminal type to control display often accept a \\-T\noption that accepts a terminal name argument.\nSuch programs should fall back\non the \\fBTERM\\fP environment variable when no \\-T option is specified.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nFor maximum compatibility with older System V UNIXes, names and aliases\nshould be unique within the first 14 characters.\n.SH FILES\n.TP 5\n\\*d/?/*\ncompiled terminal capability database\n.TP 5\n/etc/inittab\ntty line initialization (AT&T-like UNIXes)\n.TP 5\n/etc/ttys\ntty line initialization (BSD-like UNIXes)\n.SH SEE ALSO\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X), \\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n), \\fBterm\\fP(\\*n).\n",
