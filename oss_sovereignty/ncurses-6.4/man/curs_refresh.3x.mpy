SYNOPSIS\n\\fB#include <curses.h>\\fP\n.sp\n\\fBint refresh(void);\\fP\n.br\n\\fBint wrefresh(WINDOW *\\fIwin\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n\\fBint wnoutrefresh(WINDOW *\\fIwin\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n\\fBint doupdate(void);\\fP\n.sp\n\\fBint redrawwin(WINDOW *\\fIwin\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n\\fBint wredrawln(WINDOW *\\fIwin\\fB, int \\fIbeg_line\\fB, int \\fInum_lines\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n.SS refresh/wrefresh\nThe \\fBrefresh\\fP and \\fBwrefresh\\fP routines (or \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP and\n\\fBdoupdate\\fP) must be called to get actual output to the terminal,\nas other routines merely manipulate data structures.\nThe routine \\fBwrefresh\\fP copies\nthe named window to the \\fIphysical screen\\fP,\ntaking into account what is already there to do optimizations.\nThe \\fBrefresh\\fP routine is the\nsame, using \\fBstdscr\\fP as the default window.\nUnless \\fBleaveok\\fP has been\nenabled, the physical cursor of the terminal is left at the location of the\ncursor for that window.\n.SS wnoutrefresh/doupdate\n.PP\nThe \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP and \\fBdoupdate\\fP routines allow multiple updates with\nmore efficiency than \\fBwrefresh\\fP alone.\nIn addition to all the window\nstructures, \\fBcurses\\fP keeps two data structures representing the terminal\nscreen:\n.bP\na \\fIphysical screen\\fP, describing what is actually on the screen, and\n.bP\na \\fIvirtual screen\\fP, describing what the programmer wants to have on the screen.\n.PP\nThe routine \\fBwrefresh\\fP works by\n.bP\nfirst calling \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP,\nwhich copies the named window to the \\fIvirtual screen\\fP, and\n.bP\nthen calling \\fBdoupdate\\fP, which compares\nthe \\fIvirtual screen\\fP to the \\fIphysical screen\\fP\nand does the actual update.\n.PP\nIf the programmer wishes to output several windows at once, a series\nof calls to \\fBwrefresh\\fP results in alternating calls to \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP\nand \\fBdoupdate\\fP, causing several bursts of output to the screen.\nBy first\ncalling \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP for each window, it is then possible to call\n\\fBdoupdate\\fP once, resulting in only one burst of output, with fewer total\ncharacters transmitted and less CPU time used.\n.PP\nIf the \\fIwin\\fP argument to\n\\fBwrefresh\\fP is the \\fIphysical screen\\fP\n(i.e., the global variable \\fBcurscr\\fP),\nthe screen is immediately cleared and repainted from scratch.\n.PP\nThe phrase \\*(``copies the named window\nto the virtual screen\\*('' above is ambiguous.\nWhat actually happens is that all \\fItouched\\fP (changed) lines in the window\nare copied to the virtual screen.\nThis affects programs that use overlapping\nwindows; it means that if two windows overlap, you can refresh them in either\norder and the overlap region will be modified only when it is explicitly\nchanged.\n(But see the section on \\fBPORTABILITY\\fP below for a warning about\nexploiting this behavior.)\n.SS wredrawln/redrawwin\n.PP\nThe \\fBwredrawln\\fP routine indicates to \\fBcurses\\fP that some screen lines\nare corrupted and should be thrown away before anything is written over them.\nIt touches the indicated lines (marking them changed).\nThe routine \\fBredrawwin\\fP touches the entire window.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nRoutines that return an integer return \\fBERR\\fP upon failure, and \\fBOK\\fP\n(SVr4 only specifies \"an integer value other than \\fBERR\\fP\") upon successful\ncompletion.\n.PP\nX/Open does not define any error conditions.\nIn this implementation\n.RS 3\n.TP 5\n\\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP\nreturns an error\nif the window pointer is null, or\nif the window is really a pad.\n.TP 5\n\\fBwredrawln\\fP\nreturns an error\nif the associated call to \\fBtouchln\\fP returns an error.\n.RE\n.SH NOTES\nNote that \\fBrefresh\\fP and \\fBredrawwin\\fP may be macros.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nThe XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.\n.PP\nWhether \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP copies to the virtual screen the entire contents\nof a window or just its changed portions has never been well-documented in\nhistoric curses versions (including SVr4).\nIt might be unwise to rely on\neither behavior in programs that might have to be linked with other curses\nimplementations.\nInstead, you can do an explicit \\fBtouchwin\\fP before the\n\\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP call to guarantee an entire-contents copy anywhere.\n.SH SEE
