exit_terminfo(int \\fIcode\\fB);\\fR\n.sp\n/* deprecated (intentionally not declared in curses.h or term.h) */\n.br\n\\fBvoid _nc_freeall(void);\\fP\n.br\n\\fBvoid _nc_free_and_exit(int \\fIcode\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n\\fBvoid _nc_free_tinfo(int \\fIcode\\fB);\\fR\n.SH DESCRIPTION\nThese functions are used to simplify analysis of memory leaks in the ncurses\nlibrary.\n.PP\nAny implementation of curses must not free the memory associated with\na screen, since (even after calling \\fBendwin\\fP(3X)), it must be available\nfor use in the next call to \\fBrefresh\\fP(3X).\nThere are also chunks of memory held for performance reasons.\nThat makes it hard to analyze curses applications for memory leaks.\nWhen using the specially configured debugging version of the ncurses library,\napplications can call functions which free those chunks of memory,\nsimplifying the process of memory-leak checking.\n.PP\nSome of the functions are named with a \\*(``_nc_\\*('' prefix\nbecause they are not intended for use in the non-debugging library:\n.TP 5\n\\fB_nc_freeall\\fP\nThis frees (almost) all of the memory allocated by ncurses.\n.TP 5\n\\fB_nc_free_and_exit\\fP\nThis frees the memory allocated by ncurses (like \\fB_nc_freeall\\fP),\nand exits the program.\nIt is preferred over \\fB_nc_freeall\\fP since some of that memory\nmay be required to keep the application running.\nSimply exiting (with the given exit-code) is safer.\n.TP 5\n\\fB_nc_free_tinfo\\fP\nUse this function if only the low-level terminfo functions (and\ncorresponding library) are used.\nLike \\fB_nc_free_and_exit\\fP, it exits the program after freeing memory.\n.PP\nThe functions prefixed \\*(``_nc\\*('' are normally not available;\nthey must be configured into the library\nat build time using the \\fB\\-\\-disable-leaks\\fP option.\nThat compiles-in code that frees memory that normally would not be freed.\n.PP\nThe \\fBexit_curses\\fP and \\fBexit_terminfo\\fP functions\ncall \\fB_nc_free_and_exit\\fP and \\fB_nc_free_tinfo\\fP if\nthe library is configured to support memory-leak checking.\nIf the library is not configured to support memory-leak checking,\nthey simply call \\fBexit\\fP.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nThese functions do not return a value.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nThese functions are not part of X/Open Curses;\nnor do other implementations of curses provide a similar feature.\n.PP\nIn any implementation of X/Open Curses, an application can free part\nof the memory allocated by curses:\n.bP\nThe portable part of \\fBexit_curses\\fP can be freed using \\fBdelscreen\\fP,\npassing the \\fBSCREEN*\\fP pointer returned by \\fBnewterm\\fP.\n.IP\nIn some implementations, there is a global variable \\fBsp\\fP\nwhich could be used, e.g., if the screen were only initialized\nusing \\fBinitscr\\fP.\n.bP\nThe portable part of \\fBexit_terminfo\\fP can be freed using \\fBdel_curterm\\fP.\n.IP\nIn this case, there is a global variable \\fBcur_term\\fP which can be\nused as parameter.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n\\fBcurs_initscr\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_terminfo\\fP(3X).\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X).\n",
