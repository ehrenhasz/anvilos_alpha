the\nbackground of the named window.\nThe window background is a \\fBcchar_t\\fP consisting of\nany combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and a complex character.\n.bP\nThe attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed) with all non-blank\ncharacters that are written into the window with \\fBwaddch\\fP.\n.bP\nBoth\nthe character and attribute parts of the background are combined with\nthe blank characters.\n.PP\nThe background becomes a property of the\ncharacter and moves with the character through any scrolling and\ninsert/delete line/character operations.\n.PP\nTo the extent possible on a\nparticular terminal, the attribute part of the background is displayed\nas the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.\n.SS bkgrnd\n.PP\nThe \\fBbkgrnd\\fP and \\fBwbkgrnd\\fP functions\nset the background property of the current or specified window\nand then apply this setting to every character position in that window:\n.bP\nThe rendition of every character on the screen is changed to\nthe new background rendition.\n.bP\nWherever the former background character\nappears, it is changed to the new background character.\n.SS getbkgrnd\n.PP\nThe \\fBgetbkgrnd\\fP function returns the given window's current background\ncharacter/attribute pair via the \\fBwch\\fP pointer.\nIf the given window pointer is null,\nthe character is not updated (but no error returned).\n.SH NOTES\nNote that\n\\fBbkgrnd\\fP,\n\\fBbkgrndset\\fP, and\n\\fBgetbkgrnd\\fP\nmay be macros.\n.PP\nX/Open Curses does not provide details on how the rendition is changed.\nThis implementation follows the approach used in SVr4 curses,\nwhich is explained in the manual page for \\fBwbkgd\\fP.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\n.PP\nThe \\fBbkgrndset\\fP and \\fBwbkgrndset\\fP routines do not return a value.\n.PP\nUpon successful completion, the other functions return \\fBOK\\fP.\nOtherwise, they return \\fBERR\\fP:\n.bP\nA null window pointer is treated as an error.\n.bP\nA null character pointer is treated as an error.\n.SH PORTABILITY\n.PP\nThese functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4\n(X/Open Curses).\n.SH SEE
