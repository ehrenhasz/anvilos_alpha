\\fI[tabstop-list]\\fP\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n.PP\nThe \\fB@TABS@\\fP program clears and sets tab-stops on the terminal.\nThis uses the terminfo \\fBclear_all_tabs\\fP and \\fBset_tab\\fP capabilities.\nIf either is absent, \\fB@TABS@\\fP is unable to clear/set tab-stops.\nThe terminal should be configured to use hard tabs, e.g.,\n.NS\nstty tab0\n.NE\n.PP\nLike \\fB@CLEAR@\\fP(1), \\fB@TABS@\\fP writes to the standard output.\nYou can redirect the standard output to a file (which prevents\n\\fB@TABS@\\fP from actually changing the tabstops),\nand later \\fBcat\\fP the file to the screen, setting tabstops at that point.\n.PP\nThese are hardware tabs, which cannot be queried rapidly by applications\nrunning in the terminal, if at all.\nCurses and other full-screen applications may use hardware tabs\nin optimizing their output to the terminal.\nIf the hardware tabstops differ from the information in the terminal\ndatabase, the result is unpredictable.\nBefore running curses programs,\nyou should either reset tab-stops to the standard interval\n.NS\ntabs -8\n.NE\n.PP\nor use the \\fB@RESET@\\fP program,\nsince the normal initialization sequences do not ensure that tab-stops\nare reset.\n.SH OPTIONS\n.SS General Options\n.TP 5\n.BI \\-T \"name\"\nTell \\fB@TABS@\\fP which terminal type to use.\nIf this option is not given, \\fB@TABS@\\fP will use the \\fB$TERM\\fP\nenvironment variable.\nIf that is not set, it will use the \\fIansi+tabs\\fP entry.\n.TP 5\n.B \\-d\nThe debugging option shows a ruler line, followed by two data lines.\nThe first data line shows the expected tab-stops marked with asterisks.\nThe second data line shows the actual tab-stops, marked with asterisks.\n.TP 5\n.B \\-n\nThis option tells \\fB@TABS@\\fP to check the options and run any debugging\noption, but not to modify the terminal settings.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-V\\fP\nreports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.\n.PP\nThe \\fB@TABS@\\fP program processes a single list of tab stops.\nThe last option to be processed which defines a list is the one that\ndetermines the list to be processed.\n.SS Implicit Lists\nUse a single number as an option,\ne.g., \\*(``\\fB\\-5\\fP\\*('' to set tabs at the given\ninterval (in this case 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, etc.).\nTabs are repeated up to the right margin of the screen.\n.PP\nUse \\*(``\\fB\\-0\\fP\\*('' to clear all tabs.\n.PP\nUse \\*(``\\fB\\-8\\fP\\*('' to set tabs to the standard interval.\n.SS Explicit Lists\nAn explicit list can be defined after the options\n(this does not use a \\*(``\\-\\*('').\nThe values in the list must be in increasing numeric order,\nand greater than zero.\nThey are separated by a comma or a blank, for example,\n.NS\ntabs 1,6,11,16,21\n.br\ntabs 1 6 11 16 21\n.NE\n.PP\nUse a \\*(``+\\*('' to treat a number\nas an increment relative to the previous value,\ne.g.,\n.NS\ntabs 1,+5,+5,+5,+5\n.NE\n.PP\nwhich is equivalent to the 1,6,11,16,21 example.\n.SS Predefined Tab-Stops\nPOSIX defines several predefined lists of tab stops.\n.TP 5\n.B \\-a\nAssembler, IBM S/370, first format\n.br\n1,10,16,36,72\n.TP 5\n.B \\-a2\nAssembler, IBM S/370, second

an option to use this feature:\n.TP 5\n.BI +m \\ margin\nThe effect depends on whether the terminal has the margin capabilities:\n.RS\n.bP\nIf the terminal provides the capability for setting the left margin,\n@TABS@ uses this, and adjusts the available width for tab-stops.\n.bP\nIf the terminal does not provide the margin capabilities,\n@TABS@ imitates the effect, putting the tab stops at the appropriate\nplace on each line.\nThe terminal's left-margin is not modified.\n.RE\n.IP\nIf the \\fImargin\\fP parameter is omitted, the default is 10.\nUse \\fB+m0\\fP to reset the left margin,\ni.e., to the left edge of the terminal's display.\nBefore setting a left-margin,\n@TABS@ resets the margin to reduce problems which might arise\non moving the cursor before the current left-margin.\n.PP\nWhen setting or resetting the left-margin,\n@TABS@ may reset the right-margin.\n.SH PORTABILITY\n.PP\n\\fIIEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7\\fP (POSIX.1-2008)\ndescribes a \\fBtabs\\fP utility.\nHowever\n.bP\nThis standard describes a \\fB+m\\fP option, to set a terminal's left-margin.\nVery few of the entries in the terminal database provide the\n\\fBsmgl\\fP (\\fBset_left_margin\\fP) or\n\\fBsmglp\\fP (\\fBset_left_margin_parm\\fP)\ncapability needed to support the feature.\n.bP\nThere is no counterpart in X/Open Curses Issue 7 for this utility,\nunlike \\fB@TPUT@\\fP(1).\n.PP\nThe \\fB\\-d\\fP (debug) and \\fB\\-n\\fP (no-op) options are extensions not provided\nby other implementations.\n.PP\nA \\fBtabs\\fP utility appeared in PWB/Unix 1.0 (1977).\nThere was a reduced version of the \\fBtabs\\fP utility\nin Unix 7th edition and in 3BSD (1979).\nThe latter supported a single \\*(``\\-n\\*('' option\n(to cause the first tab stop to be set on the left margin).\nThat option is not documented by POSIX.\n.PP\nThe PWB/Unix \\fBtabs\\fP utility, which was included in System III (1980),\nused built-in tables rather than the terminal database,\nto support a half-dozen hardcopy terminal (printer) types.\nIt also had built-in logic to support the left-margin,\nas well as a feature for copying the tab settings from a file.\n.PP\nLater versions of Unix, e.g., SVr4,\nadded support for the terminal database,\nbut kept the tables to support the printers.\nIn an earlier development effort,\nthe tab-stop initialization provided by \\fBtset\\fP (1982)\nand incorporated into \\fBtput\\fP uses the terminal database,\n.PP\nThe \\fB+m\\fP option was documented\nin the Base Specifications Issue 5 (Unix98, 1997),\nand omitted in Issue 6 (Unix03, 2004) without documenting the rationale,\nthough an introductory comment\n\\fI\\*(``and optionally adjusts the margin\\*(''\\fP remains,\noverlooked in the removal.\nThe documented \\fBtabs\\fP utility in Issues 6 and later has no mechanism\nfor setting margins.\nThe \\fB+m\\fP option in this implementation differs from the feature\nin SVr4 by using terminal capabilities rather than built-in tables.\n.PP\nPOSIX documents no limits on the number of tab stops.\nDocumentation for other implementations states that there is a limit on the\nnumber of tab stops\n(e.g., 20 in PWB/Unix's \\fBtabs\\fP utility).\nWhile some terminals may not accept an arbitrary number\nof tab stops, this implementation will attempt to set tab stops up to the\nright margin of the screen, if the given list happens to be that long.\n.PP\nThe \\fIRationale\\fP section of the POSIX documentation goes into some\ndetail about the ways the committee considered redesigning the\n\\fBtabs\\fP and \\fBtput\\fP utilities,\nwithout proposing an improved solution.\nIt comments that\n.RS 5\n.PP\nno known historical version of tabs supports the capability of setting\narbitrary tab stops.\n.RE\n.PP\nHowever, the \\fIExplicit Lists\\fP described in this manual page\nwere implemented in PWB/Unix.\nThose provide the capability of setting abitrary tab stops.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP(1M),\n\\fB@TSET@\\fP(1),\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X),\n\\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n).\n.PP\nThis describes \\fBncurses\\fP\nversion @NCURSES_MAJOR@.@NCURSES_MINOR@ (patch
