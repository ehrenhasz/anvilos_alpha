\\fIdirectory\\fP] [\\fB\\-B\\fP\\ \\fIdirectory\\fP]\n.br\n      [\\fItermname\\fP...]\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP can be used to compare a binary \\fBterminfo\\fP entry with other\nterminfo entries, rewrite a \\fBterminfo\\fP description to take advantage of the\n\\fBuse=\\fP terminfo field, or print out a \\fBterminfo\\fP description from the\nbinary file (\\fBterm\\fP) in a variety of formats.\nIn all cases, the boolean\nfields will be printed first, followed by the numeric fields, followed by the\nstring fields.\n.SS Default Options\nIf no options are specified and zero or one \\fItermnames\\fP are specified, the\n\\fB\\-I\\fP option will be assumed.\nIf more than one \\fItermname\\fP is specified,\nthe \\fB\\-d\\fP option will be assumed.\n.SS Comparison Options [\\-d] [\\-c] [\\-n]\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP compares the \\fBterminfo\\fP description of the first terminal\n\\fItermname\\fP with each of the descriptions given by the entries for the other\nterminal's \\fItermnames\\fP.\nIf a capability is defined for only one of the\nterminals, the value returned depends on the type of the capability:\n.bP\n\\fBF\\fP for missing boolean variables\n.bP\n\\fBNULL\\fP for missing integer or string variables\n.PP\nUse the \\fB\\-q\\fP option to show the distinction between\n\\fIabsent\\fP and \\fIcancelled\\fP capabilities.\n.PP\nThese options produce a list which you can use to compare two\nor more terminal descriptions:\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-d\\fP\nproduces a list of each capability that is \\fIdifferent\\fP\nbetween two entries.\nEach item in the list shows \\*(``:\\*('' after the capability name,\nfollowed by the capability values, separated by a comma.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-c\\fP\nproduces a list of each capability that is \\fIcommon\\fP between\ntwo or more entries.\nMissing capabilities are ignored.\nEach item in the list shows \\*(``=\\*('' after the capability name,\nfollowed by the capability value.\n.IP\nThe \\fB\\-u\\fP option provides a related output,\nshowing the first terminal description rewritten to use the second\nas a building block via the \\*(``use=\\*('' clause.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-n\\fP\nproduces a list of each capability that is in \\fInone\\fP of the given entries.\nEach item in the list shows \\*(``!\\*('' before the capability name.\n.IP\nNormally only the conventional capabilities are shown.\nUse the \\fB\\-x\\fP option to add the BSD-compatibility\ncapabilities (names prefixed with \\*(``OT\\*('').\n.IP\nIf no \\fItermnames\\fP are given,\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP uses the environment variable \\fBTERM\\fP\nfor each of the \\fItermnames\\fP.\n.SS Source Listing Options [\\-I] [\\-L] [\\-C] [\\-r]\nThe \\fB\\-I\\fP, \\fB\\-L\\fP, and \\fB\\-C\\fP options will produce\na source listing for each terminal named.\n.\n.TS\ncenter tab(/) ;\nl l .\n\\fB\\-I\\fP/use the \\fBterminfo\\fP names\n\\fB\\-L\\fP/use the long C variable name listed in <\\fBterm.h\\fP>\n\\fB\\-C\\fP/use the \\fBtermcap\\fP names\n\\fB\\-r\\fP/when using \\fB\\-C\\fP, put out all capabilities in \\fBtermcap\\fP form\n\\fB\\-K\\fP/modifies the \\fB\\-C\\fP option, improving BSD-compatibility.\n.TE\n.PP\nIf no \\fItermnames\\fP are given, the environment variable \\fBTERM\\fP will be\nused for the terminal name.\n.PP\nThe source produced by the \\fB\\-C\\fP option may be used directly as a\n\\fBtermcap\\fP entry, but not all parameterized strings can be changed to\nthe \\fBtermcap\\fP format.\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP will attempt to convert most of the\nparameterized information, and anything not converted will be plainly marked in\nthe output and commented out.\nThese should be edited by hand.\n.PP\nFor best results when converting to \\fBtermcap\\fP format,\nyou should use both \\fB\\-C\\fP and \\fB\\-r\\fP.\nNormally a termcap description is limited to 1023 bytes.\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP trims away less essential parts to make it fit.\nIf you are converting to one of the (rare) termcap implementations\nwhich accept an unlimited size of termcap,\nyou may want to add the \\fB\\-T\\fP option.\nMore often however, you must help the termcap implementation,\nand trim excess whitespace (use the \\fB\\-0\\fP option for that).\n.PP\nAll padding information for strings will be collected together and placed\nat the beginning of the string where \\fBtermcap\\fP expects it.\nMandatory\npadding (padding information with a trailing \\*(``/\\*('') will become optional.\n.PP\nAll \\fBtermcap\\fP variables no longer supported by \\fBterminfo\\fP, but which\nare derivable from other \\fBterminfo\\fP variables, will be output.\nNot all\n\\fBterminfo\\fP capabilities will be translated; only those variables which were\npart of \\fBtermcap\\fP will normally be output.\nSpecifying the \\fB\\-r\\fP option\nwill take off this restriction, allowing all capabilities to be output in\n\\fItermcap\\fP form.\nNormally you would use both the \\fB\\-C\\fP and \\fB\\-r\\fP options.\nThe actual format used incorporates some improvements for escaped characters\nfrom terminfo format.\nFor a stricter BSD-compatible translation, use the \\fB\\-K\\fP option\nrather than \\fB\\-C\\fP.\n.PP\nNote that because padding is collected to the beginning of the capability, not\nall capabilities are output.\nMandatory padding is not supported.\nBecause\n\\fBtermcap\\fP strings are not as flexible, it is not always possible to convert\na \\fBterminfo\\fP string capability into an equivalent \\fBtermcap\\fP format.\nA subsequent conversion of the \\fBtermcap\\fP file\nback into \\fBterminfo\\fP format\nwill not necessarily reproduce the original \\fBterminfo\\fP source.\n.PP\nSome common \\fBterminfo\\fP parameter sequences, their \\fBtermcap\\fP\nequivalents, and some terminal types which commonly have such sequences, are:\n.\n.TS\ncenter tab(/) ;\nl c l\nl l l.\n\\fBterminfo/termcap\\fP/Representative Terminals\n=\n\\fB%p1%c/%.\\fP/adm\n\\fB%p1%d/%d\\fP/hp, ANSI standard, vt100\n\\fB%p1%'x'%+%c/%+x\\fP/concept\n\\fB%i/%i\\fPq/ANSI standard, vt100\n\\fB%p1%?%'x'%>%t%p1%'y'%+%;/%>xy\\fP/concept\n\\fB%p2\\fP is printed before \\fB%p1/%r\\fP/hp\n.TE\n.SS Use= Option [\\-u]\nThe \\fB\\-u\\fP option produces a \\fBterminfo\\fP source description of the first\nterminal \\fItermname\\fP which is relative to the sum of the descriptions given\nby the entries for the other terminals \\fItermnames\\fP.\nIt does this by\nanalyzing the differences between the first \\fItermname\\fP and the other\n\\fItermnames\\fP and producing a description with \\fBuse=\\fP fields for the\nother terminals.\nIn this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo\nentries into a terminal's description.\nOr, if two similar terminals exist, but\nwere coded at different times or by different people so that each description\nis a full description, using \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP\nwill show what can be done to change\none description to be relative to the other.\n.PP\nA capability will be printed with an at-sign (@) if it no longer exists in the\nfirst \\fItermname\\fP, but one of the other \\fItermname\\fP entries contains a\nvalue for it.\nA capability's value will be printed if the value in the first\n\\fItermname\\fP is not found in any of the other \\fItermname\\fP entries, or if\nthe first of the other \\fItermname\\fP entries that has this capability gives a\ndifferent value for the capability than that in the first \\fItermname\\fP.\n.PP\nThe order of the other \\fItermname\\fP entries is significant.\nSince the\nterminfo compiler \\fB@TIC@\\fP does a left-to-right scan of the capabilities,\nspecifying two \\fBuse=\\fP entries that contain differing entries for the same\ncapabilities will produce different results depending on the order that the\nentries are given in.\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP will flag any such inconsistencies between\nthe other \\fItermname\\fP entries as they are found.\n.PP\nAlternatively, specifying a capability \\fIafter\\fP a \\fBuse=\\fP entry that\ncontains that capability will cause the second specification to be ignored.\nUsing \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP to recreate a description can be a useful check to make\nsure that everything was specified correctly in the original source\ndescription.\n.PP\nAnother error that does not cause incorrect compiled files, but will slow down\nthe compilation time, is specifying extra \\fBuse=\\fP fields that are\nsuperfluous.\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP will flag any other \\fItermname use=\\fP fields that\nwere not needed.\n.SS Changing Databases [\\-A \\fIdirectory\\fR] [\\-B \\fIdirectory\\fR]\nLike other \\fBncurses\\fP utilities,\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP looks for the terminal descriptions in several places.\nYou can use the \\fBTERMINFO\\fP and \\fBTERMINFO_DIRS\\fP environment variables\nto override the compiled-in default list of places to search\n(see \\fBcurses\\fP(3X) for details).\n.PP\nYou can also use the options \\fB\\-A\\fP\nand \\fB\\-B\\fP to override the list of places to search\nwhen comparing terminal descriptions:\n.bP\nThe \\fB\\-A\\fP option sets the location for the first \\fItermname\\fP\n.bP\nThe \\fB\\-B\\fP option sets the location for the other \\fItermnames\\fP.\n.PP\nUsing these options, it is possible to\ncompare descriptions for a terminal with the same name located in two different\ndatabases.\nFor instance,\nyou can use this feature for comparing descriptions for the same terminal\ncreated by different people.\n.SS Other Options\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-0\\fP\ncauses the fields to be printed on one line, without wrapping.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-1\\fP\ncauses the fields to be printed out one to a line.\nOtherwise,\nthe fields will be printed several to a line to a maximum width\nof 60 characters.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-a\\fP\ntells \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP to retain commented-out capabilities\nrather than discarding them.\nCapabilities are commented by prefixing them with a period.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-D\\fP\ntells \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP to print the database locations that it knows about,\nand exit.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-E\\fP\nDump the capabilities of the given terminal as tables, needed in\nthe C initializer for a\nTERMTYPE structure (the terminal capability structure in the \\fB<term.h>\\fP).\nThis option is useful for preparing versions of the curses library hardwired\nfor a given terminal type.\nThe tables are all declared static, and are named according to the type\nand the name of the corresponding terminal entry.\n.sp\nBefore ncurses 5.0, the split between the \\fB\\-e\\fP and \\fB\\-E\\fP\noptions was not needed; but support for extended names required making\nthe arrays of terminal capabilities separate from the TERMTYPE structure.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-e\\fP\nDump the capabilities of the given terminal as a C initializer for a\nTERMTYPE structure (the terminal capability structure in the \\fB<term.h>\\fP).\nThis option is useful for preparing versions of the curses library hardwired\nfor a given terminal type.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-F\\fP\ncompare terminfo files.\nThis assumes that two following arguments are filenames.\nThe files are searched for pairwise matches between\nentries, with two entries considered to match if any of their names do.\nThe report printed to standard output lists entries with no matches in\nthe other file, and entries with more than one match.\nFor entries\nwith exactly one match it includes a difference report.\nNormally,\nto reduce the volume of the report, use references are\nnot resolved before looking for differences, but resolution can be forced\nby also specifying \\fB\\-r\\fP.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-f\\fP\nDisplay complex terminfo strings which contain if/then/else/endif expressions\nindented for readability.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-G\\fP\nDisplay constant literals in decimal form\nrather than their character equivalents.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-g\\fP\nDisplay constant character literals in quoted form\nrather than their decimal equivalents.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-i\\fP\nAnalyze the initialization (\\fBis1\\fP, \\fBis2\\fP, \\fBis3\\fP), and reset\n(\\fBrs1\\fP, \\fBrs2\\fP, \\fBrs3\\fP), strings in the entry,\nas well as those used for starting/stopping cursor-positioning mode\n(\\fBsmcup\\fP, \\fBrmcup\\fP) as well as starting/stopping keymap mode\n(\\fBsmkx\\fP, \\fBrmkx\\fP).\n.IP\nFor each string, the\ncode tries to analyze it into actions in terms of the other capabilities in the\nentry, certain X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA\\-48 capabilities, and certain DEC VT-series\nprivate modes (the set of recognized special sequences has been selected for\ncompleteness over the existing terminfo database).\nEach report line consists\nof the capability name, followed by a colon and space, followed by a printable\nexpansion of the capability string with sections matching recognized actions\ntranslated into {}-bracketed descriptions.\n.IP\nHere is a list of the DEC/ANSI\nspecial sequences recognized:\n.TS\ncenter tab(/) ;\nl l\nl l.\nAction/Meaning\n=\nRIS/full

alphabetically by the \\fBterminfo\\fP name within each type,\nexcept in the case of the \\fB\\-C\\fP or the \\fB\\-L\\fP options, which cause the\nsorting to be done by the \\fBtermcap\\fP name or the long C variable\nname, respectively.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-T\\fP\neliminates size-restrictions on the generated text.\nThis is mainly useful for testing and analysis, since the compiled\ndescriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo).\n.TP\n\\fB\\-t\\fP\ntells \\fB@TIC@\\fP to discard commented-out capabilities.\nNormally when translating from terminfo to termcap,\nuntranslatable capabilities are commented-out.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-U\\fP\ntells \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP to not post-process the data\nafter parsing the source file.\nThis feature helps when comparing the actual contents of two source files,\nsince it excludes the inferences that \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP makes to fill in missing\ndata.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-V\\fP\nreports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and

desired level of detail of information.\nIf ncurses is built without tracing support, the optional parameter is ignored.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-W\\fP\nBy itself, the \\fB\\-w\\fP option will not force long strings to be wrapped.\nUse the \\fB\\-W\\fP option to do this.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-w\\fP \\fIwidth\\fP\nchanges the output to \\fIwidth\\fP characters.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-x\\fP\nprint information for

20\n\\*d\nCompiled terminal description database.\n.SH HISTORY\nAlthough System V Release 2 provided a terminfo library,\nit had no documented tool for decompiling the terminal descriptions.\nTony Hansen (AT&T) wrote the first \\fBinfocmp\\fP in early 1984,\nfor System V Release 3.\n.PP\nEric Raymond used the AT&T documentation in 1995 to provide an equivalent\n\\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP for ncurses.\nIn addition, he added a few new features such as:\n.bP\nthe \\fB\\-e\\fP option, to support \\fIfallback\\fP\n(compiled-in) terminal descriptions\n.bP\nthe \\fB\\-i\\fP option, to help with analysis\n.PP\nLater, Thomas Dickey added the \\fB\\-x\\fP (user-defined capabilities)\noption, and the \\fB\\-E\\fP option to support fallback entries with\nuser-defined capabilities.\n.PP\nFor a complete list, see the \\fIEXTENSIONS\\fP section.\n.PP\nIn 2010, Roy Marples provided an \\fBinfocmp\\fP program for NetBSD.\nIt is less capable than the SVr4 or ncurses versions\n(e.g., it lacks the sorting options documented in X/Open),\nbut does include the \\fB\\-x\\fP option adapted from ncurses.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nX/Open Curses, Issue 7 (2009) provides a description of \\fBinfocmp\\fP.\nIt
