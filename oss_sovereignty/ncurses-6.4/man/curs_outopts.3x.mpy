DESCRIPTION\n.PP\nThese routines set options that change the style of output within\n\\fBcurses\\fP.\nAll options are initially \\fBFALSE\\fP, unless otherwise stated.\nIt is not necessary to turn these options off before calling \\fBendwin\\fP(3X).\n.SS clearok\n.PP\nIf \\fBclearok\\fP is called with \\fBTRUE\\fP as argument, the next\ncall to \\fBwrefresh\\fP with this window will clear the screen completely and\nredraw the entire screen from scratch.\nThis is useful when the contents of the\nscreen are uncertain, or in some cases for a more pleasing visual effect.\nIf\nthe \\fIwin\\fP argument to \\fBclearok\\fP is the global variable \\fBcurscr\\fP,\nthe next call to \\fBwrefresh\\fP with any window causes the screen to be cleared\nand repainted from scratch.\n.SS idlok\n.PP\nIf \\fBidlok\\fP is called with \\fBTRUE\\fP as second argument, \\fBcurses\\fP\nconsiders using the hardware insert/delete line feature of terminals so\nequipped.\nCalling \\fBidlok\\fP with \\fBFALSE\\fP as second argument disables use\nof line insertion and deletion.\nThis option should be enabled only if the\napplication needs insert/delete line, for example, for a screen editor.\nIt is\ndisabled by default because insert/delete line tends to be visually annoying\nwhen used in applications where it is not really needed.\nIf insert/delete line\ncannot be used, \\fBcurses\\fP redraws the changed portions of all lines.\n.SS idcok\n.PP\nIf \\fBidcok\\fP is called with \\fBFALSE\\fP as second argument, \\fBcurses\\fP\nno longer considers using the hardware insert/delete character feature of\nterminals so equipped.\nUse of character insert/delete is enabled by default.\nCalling \\fBidcok\\fP with \\fBTRUE\\fP as second argument re-enables use\nof character insertion and deletion.\n.SS immedok\n.PP\nIf \\fBimmedok\\fP is called with \\fBTRUE as argument\\fP, any change\nin the window image, such as the ones caused by \\fBwaddch, wclrtobot, wscrl\\fP,\netc., automatically cause a call to \\fBwrefresh\\fP.\nHowever, it may\ndegrade performance considerably, due to repeated calls to \\fBwrefresh\\fP.\nIt is disabled by default.\n.SS leaveok\n.PP\nNormally, the hardware cursor is left at the location of the window cursor\nbeing refreshed.\nThe \\fBleaveok\\fP option allows the cursor to be left\nwherever the update happens to leave it.\nIt is useful for applications where\nthe cursor is not used, since it reduces the need for cursor motions.\n.SS scrollok\n.PP\nThe \\fBscrollok\\fP option controls what happens when the cursor of a window is\nmoved off the edge of the window or scrolling region, either as a result of a\nnewline action on the bottom line, or typing the last character of the last\nline.\nIf disabled, (\\fIbf\\fP is \\fBFALSE\\fP), the cursor is left on the bottom\nline.\nIf enabled, (\\fIbf\\fP is \\fBTRUE\\fP), the window is scrolled up one line\n(Note that to get the physical scrolling effect on the terminal, it is\nalso necessary to call \\fBidlok\\fP).\n.SS  setscrreg/wsetscrreg\n.PP\nThe \\fBsetscrreg\\fP and \\fBwsetscrreg\\fP routines allow the application\nprogrammer to set a software scrolling region in a window.\nThe \\fItop\\fP and\n\\fIbot\\fP parameters\nare the line numbers of the top and bottom margin of the scrolling\nregion.\n(Line 0 is the top line of the window.)  If this option and\n\\fBscrollok\\fP are enabled, an attempt to move off the bottom margin line\ncauses all lines in the scrolling region to scroll one line in the direction\nof the first line.\nOnly the text of the window is scrolled.\n(Note that this\nhas nothing to do with the use of a physical scrolling region capability in the\nterminal, like that in the VT100.\nIf \\fBidlok\\fP is enabled and the terminal\nhas either a scrolling region or insert/delete line capability, they will\nprobably be used by the output routines.)\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nThe functions \\fBsetscrreg\\fP and \\fBwsetscrreg\\fP return \\fBOK\\fP upon success\nand \\fBERR\\fP upon failure.\nAll other routines that return an integer always\nreturn \\fBOK\\fP.\n.PP\nX/Open Curses does not define any error conditions.\n.PP\nIn this implementation,\n.bP\nthose functions that have a window pointer\nwill return an error if the window pointer is null\n.bP\n\\fBwsetscrreg\\fP\nreturns an error if the scrolling region limits extend outside the window.\n.RE\n.PP\nX/Open does not define any error conditions.\nThis implementation returns an error\nif the window pointer is null.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nThese functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.\n.PP\nFrom the outset, ncurses used \\fBnl\\fP/\\fBnonl\\fP to control the conversion\nof newlines to carriage return/line-feed on output as well as input.\nXSI Curses documents only the use of these functions for input.\nThis difference arose from converting the \\fIpcurses\\fP source\n(which used \\fBioctl\\fP calls with the \\fBsgttyb\\fP structure)\nto termios (i.e., the POSIX terminal interface).\nIn the former, both input and output were controlled via a single\noption \\fBCRMOD\\fP,\nwhile the latter separates these features.\nBecause that conversion interferes with output optimization,\n\\fBnl\\fP/\\fBnonl\\fP were amended after ncurses 6.2\nto eliminate their effect on output.\n.PP\nSome historic curses implementations had, as an undocumented feature, the\nability to do the equivalent of \\fBclearok(..., 1)\\fP by saying\n\\fBtouchwin(stdscr)\\fP or \\fBclear(stdscr)\\fP.\nThis will not work under ncurses.\n.PP\nEarlier System V curses implementations specified that with \\fBscrollok\\fP\nenabled, any window modification triggering a scroll also forced a physical\nrefresh.\nXSI Curses does not require this, and \\fBncurses\\fP avoids doing\nit to perform better vertical-motion optimization at \\fBwrefresh\\fP\ntime.\n.PP\nThe XSI Curses standard does not mention that the cursor should be\nmade invisible as a side-effect of \\fBleaveok\\fP.\nSVr4 curses documentation does this, but the code does not.\nUse \\fBcurs_set\\fP to make the cursor invisible.\n.SH NOTES\nNote that\n\\fBclearok\\fP,\n\\fBleaveok\\fP,\n\\fBscrollok\\fP,\n\\fBidcok\\fP, and\n\\fBsetscrreg\\fP may be macros.\n.PP\nThe \\fBimmedok\\fP routine is useful for windows that are used as terminal\nemulators.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n.na\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_addch\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_clear\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_initscr\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_scroll\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_refresh\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_variables\\fP(3X).\n",
