\\fB@TIC@\\fP command translates a \\fBterminfo\\fP file from source\nformat into compiled format.\nThe compiled format is necessary for use with\nthe library routines in \\fBncurses\\fP(3X).\n.PP\nAs described in \\fBterm\\fP(\\*n), the database may be either a directory\ntree (one file per terminal entry) or a hashed database (one record per entry).\nThe \\fB@TIC@\\fP command writes only one type of entry,\ndepending on how it was built:\n.bP\nFor directory trees, the top-level directory, e.g., /usr/share/terminfo,\nspecifies the location of the database.\n.bP\nFor hashed databases, a filename is needed.\nIf the given file is not found by that name,\nbut can be found by adding the suffix \".db\",\nthen that is used.\n.IP\nThe default name for the hashed database is the same as the\ndefault directory name (only adding a \".db\" suffix).\n.PP\nIn either case (directory or hashed database),\n\\fB@TIC@\\fP will create the container if it does not exist.\nFor a directory, this would be the \\*(``terminfo\\*('' leaf,\nversus a \"terminfo.db\" file.\n.PP\nThe results are normally placed in the system terminfo database \\fB\\*d\\fP.\nThe compiled terminal description can be placed\nin a different terminfo database.\nThere are two ways to achieve this:\n.bP\nFirst, you may override the system default either by\nusing the \\fB\\-o\\fP option,\nor by setting the variable \\fBTERMINFO\\fP\nin your shell environment to a valid database location.\n.bP\nSecondly, if \\fB@TIC@\\fP cannot write in \\fI\\*d\\fP\nor the location specified using your TERMINFO variable,\nit looks for the directory \\fI$HOME/.terminfo\\fP\n(or hashed database \\fI$HOME/.terminfo.db)\\fP;\nif that location exists, the entry is placed there.\n.PP\nLibraries that read terminfo entries are expected to check in succession\n.bP\na location specified with the TERMINFO environment variable,\n.bP\n\\fI$HOME/.terminfo\\fP,\n.bP\ndirectories listed in the TERMINFO_DIRS environment variable,\n.bP\na compiled-in list of directories (@TERMINFO_DIRS@), and\n.bP\nthe system terminfo database (\\fI\\*d\\fP).\n.SS ALIASES\n.PP\nThis is the same program as @INFOTOCAP@ and @CAPTOINFO@;\nusually those are linked to, or copied from this program:\n.bP\nWhen invoked as @INFOTOCAP@, @TIC@ sets the \\fB\\-I\\fP option.\n.bP\nWhen invoked as @CAPTOINFO@, @TIC@ sets the \\fB\\-C\\fP option.\n.SS OPTIONS\n.TP\n\\fB\\-0\\fP\nrestricts the output to a single line\n.TP\n\\fB\\-1\\fP\nrestricts the output to a single column\n.TP\n\\fB\\-a\\fP\ntells \\fB@TIC@\\fP to retain commented-out capabilities rather than discarding\nthem.\nCapabilities are commented by prefixing them with a period.\nThis sets the \\fB\\-x\\fP option, because it treats the commented-out\nentries as user-defined names.\nIf the source is termcap, accept the 2-character names required by version 6.\nOtherwise these are ignored.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-C\\fP\nForce source translation to termcap format.\nNote: this differs from the \\fB\\-C\\fP\noption of \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP(1M) in that it does not merely translate capability\nnames, but also translates terminfo strings to termcap format.\nCapabilities\nthat are not translatable are left in the entry under their terminfo names\nbut commented out with two preceding dots.\nThe actual format used incorporates some improvements for escaped characters\nfrom terminfo format.\nFor a stricter BSD-compatible translation, add the \\fB\\-K\\fP option.\n.IP\nIf this is combined with \\fB\\-c\\fP, \\fB@TIC@\\fP makes additional checks\nto report cases where the terminfo values do not have an exact equivalent\nin termcap form.\nFor example:\n.RS\n.bP\n\\fBsgr\\fP usually will not convert, because termcap lacks the ability to\nwork with more than two parameters, and because termcap lacks many of\nthe arithmetic/logical operators used in terminfo.\n.bP\ncapabilities with more than one delay or with delays before the end of\nthe string will not convert completely.\n.RE\n.TP\n\\fB\\-c\\fP\ntells \\fB@TIC@\\fP to only check \\fIfile\\fP for errors,\nincluding syntax problems and bad use-links.\nIf you specify \\fB\\-C\\fP (\\fB\\-I\\fP) with this option, the code\nwill print warnings about entries which, after use resolution, are more than\n1023 (4096) bytes long.\nDue to a fixed buffer length in older termcap libraries,\nas well as buggy checking for the buffer length\n(and a documented limit in terminfo),\nthese entries may cause core\ndumps with other implementations.\n.IP\n\\fB@TIC@\\fP checks string capabilities to ensure that those with parameters\nwill be valid expressions.\nIt does this check only for the predefined string capabilities;\nthose which are defined with the \\fB\\-x\\fP option are ignored.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-D\\fP\ntells \\fB@TIC@\\fP to print the database locations that it knows about, and exit.\nThe first location shown is the one to which it would write compiled\nterminal descriptions.\nIf \\fB@TIC@\\fP is not able to find a writable database location\naccording to the rules summarized above,\nit will print a diagnostic and exit with an error rather than\nprinting a list of database locations.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-e \\fInames\\fR\nLimit writes and translations to the following comma-separated list of\nterminals.\nIf any name or alias of a terminal matches one of the names in\nthe list, the entry will be written or translated as normal.\nOtherwise no output will be generated for it.\nThe option value is interpreted as a file containing the list if it\ncontains a '/'.\n(Note: depending on how @TIC@ was compiled,\nthis option may require \\fB\\-I\\fP or \\fB\\-C\\fP.)\n.TP\n\\fB\\-f\\fP\nDisplay complex terminfo strings which contain if/then/else/endif expressions\nindented for readability.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-G\\fP\nDisplay constant literals in decimal form\nrather than their character equivalents.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-g\\fP\nDisplay constant character literals in quoted form\nrather than their decimal equivalents.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-I\\fP\nForce source translation to terminfo format.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-K\\fP\nSuppress some longstanding ncurses extensions to termcap format,\ne.g., \"\\\\s\" for space.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-L\\fP\nForce source translation to terminfo format\nusing the long C variable names listed in <\\fBterm.h\\fP>\n.TP\n\\fB\\-N\\fP\nDisable smart defaults.\nNormally, when translating from termcap to terminfo, the compiler makes\na number of assumptions about the defaults of string capabilities\n\\fBreset1_string\\fP, \\fBcarriage_return\\fP, \\fBcursor_left\\fP,\n\\fBcursor_down\\fP, \\fBscroll_forward\\fP, \\fBtab\\fP, \\fBnewline\\fP,\n\\fBkey_backspace\\fP, \\fBkey_left\\fP, and \\fBkey_down\\fP, then attempts\nto use obsolete termcap capabilities to deduce correct values.\nIt also\nnormally suppresses output of obsolete termcap capabilities such as \\fBbs\\fP.\nThis option forces a more literal translation that also preserves the\nobsolete capabilities.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-o\\fIdir\\fR\nWrite compiled entries to given database location.\nOverrides the TERMINFO environment variable.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-Q\\fIn\\fR\nRather than show source in terminfo (text) format,\nprint the compiled (binary) format in hexadecimal or base64 form,\ndepending on the option's value:\n.RS 8\n.TP 3\n1\nhexadecimal\n.TP 3\n2\nbase64\n.TP 3\n3\nhexadecimal and base64\n.RE\n.TP\n\\fB\\-q\\fP\nSuppress comments and blank lines when showing translated source.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-R\\fIsubset\\fR\nRestrict output to a given subset.\nThis option is for use with archaic\nversions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or HP-UX that do not support\nthe full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and outright broken ports like AIX 3.x\nthat have their own extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI.\nAvailable subsets\nare \\*(``SVr1\\*('', \\*(``Ultrix\\*('', \\*(``HP\\*('', \\*(``BSD\\*('' and \\*(``AIX\\*('';\nsee \\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n) for details.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-r\\fP\nForce entry resolution (so there are no remaining tc capabilities) even\nwhen doing translation to termcap format.\nThis may be needed if you are\npreparing a termcap file for a termcap library (such as GNU termcap through\nversion 1.3 or BSD termcap through 4.3BSD) that does not handle multiple\ntc capabilities per entry.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-s\\fP\nSummarize the compile by showing the database location into which entries\nare written, and the number of entries which are compiled.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-T\\fP\neliminates size-restrictions on the generated text.\nThis is mainly useful for testing and analysis, since the compiled\ndescriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo).\n.TP\n\\fB\\-t\\fP\ntells \\fB@TIC@\\fP to discard commented-out capabilities.\nNormally when translating from terminfo to termcap,\nuntranslatable capabilities are commented-out.\n.TP 5\n\\fB\\-U\\fP\ntells \\fB@TIC@\\fP to not post-process the data after parsing the source file.\nNormally, it infers data which is commonly missing in older terminfo data,\nor in termcaps.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-V\\fP\nreports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-v\\fIn\\fR\nspecifies that (verbose) output be written to standard error trace\ninformation showing \\fB@TIC@\\fP's progress.\n.IP\nThe optional parameter \\fIn\\fP is a number from 1 to 9, inclusive,\nindicating the desired level of detail of information.\n.RS\n.bP\nIf ncurses is built without tracing support, the optional parameter is ignored.\n.bP\nIf \\fIn\\fP is omitted, the default level is 1.\n.bP\nIf \\fIn\\fP is specified and greater than 1, the level of\ndetail is increased, and the output is written (with tracing information)\nto the \\*(``trace\\*('' file.\n.RE\n.RS\n.PP\nThe debug flag levels are as follows:\n.TP 4\n1\nNames of files created and linked\n.TP\n2\nInformation related to the \\*(``use\\*('' facility\n.TP\n3\nStatistics from the hashing algorithm\n.TP\n4\nDetails of extended capabilities\n.TP\n5\n(unused)\n.TP\n6\n(unused)\n.TP\n7\nEntries into the string-table\n.TP\n8\nList of tokens encountered by scanner\n.TP\n9\nAll values computed in construction of the hash table\n.RE\n.TP\n\\fB\\-W\\fP\nBy itself, the \\fB\\-w\\fP option will not force long strings to be wrapped.\nUse the \\fB\\-W\\fP option to do this.\n.IP\nIf you specify both \\fB\\-f\\fP and \\fB\\-W\\fP options,\nthe latter is ignored when \\fB\\-f\\fP has already split the line.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-w\\fIn\\fR\nspecifies the width of the output.\nThe parameter is optional.\nIf it is omitted, it defaults to 60.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-x\\fP\nTreat unknown capabilities as user-defined (see \\fBuser_caps(\\*n)\\fP).\nThat is, if you supply a capability name which \\fB@TIC@\\fP does not recognize,\nit will infer its type (boolean, number or string) from the syntax and\nmake an extended table entry for that.\nUser-defined capability strings\nwhose name begins with \\*(``k\\*('' are treated as function keys.\n.SS PARAMETERS\n.TP\n\\fIfile\\fP\ncontains one or more \\fBterminfo\\fP terminal descriptions in source\nformat [see \\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n)].\nEach description in the file\ndescribes the capabilities of a particular terminal.\n.IP\nIf \\fIfile\\fP is \\*(``-\\*('', then the data is read from the standard input.\nThe \\fIfile\\fP parameter may also be the path of a character-device.\n.SS PROCESSING\n.PP\nAll but one of the capabilities recognized by \\fB@TIC@\\fP are documented\nin \\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n).\nThe exception is the \\fBuse\\fP capability.\n.PP\nWhen a \\fBuse\\fP=\\fIentry\\fP\\-\\fIname\\fP field is discovered in a\nterminal entry currently being compiled, \\fB@TIC@\\fP reads in the binary\nfrom \\fB\\*d\\fP to complete the entry.\n(Entries created from\n\\fIfile\\fP will be used first.\n\\fB@TIC@\\fP duplicates the capabilities in\n\\fIentry\\fP\\-\\fIname\\fP for the current entry, with the exception of\nthose capabilities that explicitly are defined in the current entry.\n.PP\nWhen an entry, e.g., \\fBentry_name_1\\fP, contains a\n\\fBuse=\\fIentry\\fR_\\fIname\\fR_\\fI2\\fR field, any canceled\ncapabilities in \\fIentry\\fR_\\fIname\\fR_\\fI2\\fP must also appear in\n\\fBentry_name_1\\fP before \\fBuse=\\fP for these capabilities to be\ncanceled in \\fBentry_name_1\\fP.\n.PP\nTotal compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes.\nThe name field cannot\nexceed 512 bytes.\nTerminal names exceeding the maximum alias length\n(32 characters on systems with long filenames, 14 characters otherwise)\nwill be truncated to the maximum alias length\nand a warning message will be printed.\n.SH HISTORY\n.PP\nSystem V Release 2 provided a \\fBtic\\fP utility.\nIt accepted a single option: \\fB\\-v\\fP (optionally followed by a number).\nAccording to Ross Ridge's comment in \\fImytinfo\\fP,\nthis version of \\fBtic\\fP was\nunable to represent cancelled capabilities.\n.PP\nSystem V Release 3 provided a different \\fBtic\\fP utility,\nwritten by Pavel Curtis,\n(originally named \\*(``compile\\*('' in \\fIpcurses\\fP).\nThis added an option \\fB\\-c\\fP to check the file for\nerrors, with the caveat that errors in \\*(``use=\\*('' links\nwould not be reported.\nSystem V Release 3 documented a few warning messages which\ndid not appear in \\fIpcurses\\fP.\nWhile the program itself was changed little as development\ncontinued with System V Release 4,\nthe table of capabilities grew from 180 (\\fIpcurses\\fP) to 464 (Solaris).\n.PP\nIn early development of ncurses (1993),\nZeyd Ben-Halim used the table from \\fImytinfo\\fP to\nextend the \\fIpcurses\\fP table to 469 capabilities\n(456 matched SVr4, 8 were only in SVr4, 13 were not in SVr4).\nOf those 13, 11 were ultimately discarded\n(perhaps to match the draft of X/Open Curses).\nThe exceptions were\n\\fBmemory_lock_above\\fP and\n\\fBmemory_unlock\\fP (see \\fBuser_caps\\fP(5)).\n.PP\nEric Raymond incorporated parts of \\fImytinfo\\fP into ncurses\nto implement the termcap-to-terminfo source conversion,\nand extended that to begin development of\nthe corresponding terminfo-to-termcap source conversion,\nThomas Dickey completed that development over the course of several years.\n.PP\nIn 1999, Thomas Dickey added the \\fB\\-x\\fP option\nto support user-defined capabilities.\n.PP\nIn 2010, Roy Marples provided a \\fBtic\\fP program\nand terminfo library for NetBSD.\nThat implementation adapts several features from ncurses,\nincluding \\fB@TIC@\\fP's \\fB\\-x\\fP option.\n.PP\nThe \\fB\\-c\\fP option tells \\fB@TIC@\\fP to check for problems in the\nterminfo source file.\nContinued development provides additional checks:\n.bP\n\\fIpcurses\\fP had 8 warnings\n.bP\nncurses in 1996 had 16 warnings\n.bP\nSolaris (SVr4) curses has 28 warnings\n.bP\nNetBSD tic in 2019 has 19 warnings.\n.bP\nncurses in 2019 has 96 warnings\n.PP\nThe checking done in ncurses' \\fB@TIC@\\fP helps with the conversion to\ntermcap, as well as pointing out errors and inconsistencies.\nIt is also used to ensure consistency with the user-defined capabilities.\nThere are 527 distinct capabilities in ncurses' terminal database;\n128 of those are user-defined.\n.SH PORTABILITY\n.PP\nX/Open Curses, Issue 7 (2009) provides a brief description of \\fBtic\\fP.\nIt lists one option: \\fB\\-c\\fP.\nThe omission of \\fB\\-v\\fP is unexpected.\nThe change history states that the description is derived from True64 UNIX.\nAccording to its manual pages, that system also supported the \\fB\\-v\\fP option.\n.PP\nShortly after Issue 7 was released, Tru64 was discontinued.\nAs of 2019, the surviving implementations of \\fBtic\\fP\nare SVr4 (AIX, HP-UX and Solaris),\nncurses\nand NetBSD curses.\nThe SVr4 \\fBtic\\fP programs all support the \\fB\\-v\\fP option.\nThe NetBSD \\fBtic\\fP program follows X/Open's documentation,\nomitting the \\fB\\-v\\fP option.\n.PP\nThe X/Open rationale states that some implementations of \\fBtic\\fP\nread terminal descriptions from the standard input if the \\fIfile\\fP\nparameter is omitted.\nNone of these implementations do that.\nFurther, it comments that some may choose to read from \\*(''./terminfo.src\\*(''\nbut that is obsolescent behavior from SVr2,\nand is not (for example) a documented feature of SVr3.\n.SS COMPATIBILITY\nThere is some evidence that historic \\fB@TIC@\\fP implementations treated\ndescription fields with no whitespace in them as additional aliases or\nshort names.\nThis \\fB@TIC@\\fP does not do that, but it does warn when\ndescription fields may be treated that way and check them for dangerous\ncharacters.\n.SS EXTENSIONS\nUnlike the SVr4 \\fB@TIC@\\fP command, this implementation can actually\ncompile termcap sources.\nIn fact, entries in terminfo and termcap syntax can\nbe mixed in a single source file.\nSee \\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n) for the list of\ntermcap names taken to be equivalent to terminfo names.\n.PP\nThe SVr4 manual pages are not clear on the resolution rules for \\fBuse\\fP\ncapabilities.\nThis implementation of \\fB@TIC@\\fP will find \\fBuse\\fP targets anywhere\nin the source file, or anywhere in the file tree rooted at \\fBTERMINFO\\fP (if\n\\fBTERMINFO\\fP is defined),\nor in the user's \\fI$HOME/.terminfo\\fP database\n(if it exists),\nor (finally) anywhere in the system's file tree of\ncompiled entries.\n.PP\nThe error messages from this \\fB@TIC@\\fP have the same format as GNU C\nerror messages, and can be parsed by GNU Emacs's compile facility.\n.PP\nAside from \\fB\\-c\\fP and \\fB\\-v\\fP, options are not portable:\n.bP\nMost of @TIC@'s options\nare not supported by SVr4 \\fBtic\\fP:\n.sp\n.RS\n\\fB\\-0\\fP\n\\fB\\-1\\fP\n\\fB\\-C\\fP\n\\fB\\-G\\fP\n\\fB\\-I\\fP\n\\fB\\-N\\fP\n\\fB\\-R\\fP\n\\fB\\-T\\fP\n\\fB\\-V\\fP\n\\fB\\-a\\fP\n\\fB\\-e\\fP\n\\fB\\-f\\fP\n\\fB\\-g\\fP\n\\fB\\-o\\fP\n\\fB\\-r\\fP\n\\fB\\-s\\fP\n\\fB\\-t\\fP\n\\fB\\-x\\fP\n.RE\n.bP\nThe
