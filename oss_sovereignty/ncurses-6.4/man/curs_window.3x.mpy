lines and columns.\nThe upper left-hand corner of the window is\nat\n.RS\nline \\fIbegin\\fR_\\fIy\\fP,\n.br\ncolumn \\fIbegin\\fR_\\fIx\\fP\n.RE\n.PP\nIf either\n\\fInlines\\fP or \\fIncols\\fP is

\\fBnewwin(0,0,0,0)\\fP.\n.PP\nRegardless of the function used for creating a new window\n(e.g., \\fBnewwin\\fP, \\fBsubwin\\fP, \\fBderwin\\fP, \\fBnewpad\\fP),\nrather than a duplicate (with \\fBdupwin\\fP),\nall of the window modes are initialized to the default values.\nThese functions set window modes after a window is created:\n.RS\n.na\n.PP\nidcok,\nidlok,\nimmedok,\nkeypad,\nleaveok,\nnodelay,\nscrollok,\nsetscrreg,\nsyncok,\nwbkgdset,\nwbkgrndset, and\nwtimeout\n.RE\n.ad\n.SS delwin\n.PP\nCalling \\fBdelwin\\fP deletes the named window, freeing all memory\nassociated with it (it does not actually erase the window's screen\nimage).\nSubwindows must be deleted before the main window can be deleted.\n.SS mvwin\n.PP\nCalling \\fBmvwin\\fP moves the window so that the upper left-hand\ncorner is at position (\\fIx\\fP, \\fIy\\fP).\nIf the move would cause the window to be off the screen,\nit is an error and the window is not moved.\nMoving subwindows is allowed, but should be avoided.\n.SS subwin\n.PP\nCalling \\fBsubwin\\fP creates and returns a pointer to a new window\nwith the given number of lines, \\fInlines\\fP, and columns, \\fIncols\\fP.\nThe window is at position (\\fIbegin\\fR_\\fIy\\fP,\n\\fIbegin\\fR_\\fIx\\fP) on the screen.\nThe subwindow shares memory with the window \\fIorig\\fP,\nso that changes made to one window\nwill affect both windows.\nWhen using this routine, it is necessary to call\n\\fBtouchwin\\fP or \\fBtouchline\\fP on \\fIorig\\fP before calling\n\\fBwrefresh\\fP on the subwindow.\n.SS derwin\n.PP\nCalling \\fBderwin\\fP is the same as calling \\fBsubwin,\\fP except that\n\\fIbegin\\fR_\\fIy\\fP and \\fIbegin\\fR_\\fIx\\fP are relative to the origin\nof the window \\fIorig\\fP rather than the screen.\nThere is no difference between the subwindows and the derived windows.\n.PP\nCalling \\fBmvderwin\\fP moves a derived window (or subwindow)\ninside its parent window.\nThe screen-relative parameters of the window are not changed.\nThis routine is used to display different\nparts of the parent window at the same physical position on the\nscreen.\n.SS dupwin\n.PP\nCalling \\fBdupwin\\fP creates an exact duplicate of the window \\fIwin\\fP.\n.SS wsyncup\n.PP\nCalling \\fBwsyncup\\fP touches all locations in ancestors of \\fIwin\\fP that are\nchanged in \\fIwin\\fP.\nIf \\fBsyncok\\fP is called with second argument\n\\fBTRUE\\fP then \\fBwsyncup\\fP is called automatically whenever there is a\nchange in the window.\n.SS wsyncdown\n.PP\nThe \\fBwsyncdown\\fP routine touches each location in \\fIwin\\fP that has been\ntouched in any of its ancestor windows.\nThis routine is called by\n\\fBwrefresh\\fP, so it should almost never be necessary to call it manually.\n.SS wcursyncup\n.PP\nThe routine \\fBwcursyncup\\fP updates the current cursor position of all the\nancestors of the window to reflect the current cursor position of the\nwindow.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nRoutines that return an integer return the integer \\fBERR\\fP upon failure and\n\\fBOK\\fP (SVr4 only specifies \"an integer value other than \\fBERR\\fP\") upon\nsuccessful completion.\n.PP\nRoutines that return pointers return \\fBNULL\\fP on error.\n.PP\nX/Open defines no error conditions.\nIn this implementation\n.TP 5\n\\fBdelwin\\fP\nreturns an error if the window pointer is null, or\nif the window is the parent of another window.\n.TP 5\n\\fBderwin\\fP\nreturns an error if the parent window pointer is null, or\nif any of its ordinates or dimensions is negative, or\nif the resulting window does not fit inside the parent window.\n.TP 5\n\\fBdupwin\\fP\nreturns an error if the window pointer is null.\n.IP\nThis implementation also maintains a list of windows,\nand checks that the pointer passed to \\fBdelwin\\fP is one that\nit created, returning an error if it was not..\n.TP 5\n\\fBmvderwin\\fP\nreturns an error\nif the window pointer is null, or\nif some part of the window would be placed off-screen.\n.TP 5\n\\fBmvwin\\fP\nreturns an error\nif the window pointer is null, or\nif the window is really a pad, or\nif some part of the window would be placed off-screen.\n.TP 5\n\\fBnewwin\\fP\nwill fail if either of its beginning ordinates is negative, or\nif either the number of lines or columns is negative.\n.TP 5\n\\fBsyncok\\fP\nreturns an error\nif the window pointer is null.\n.TP 5\n\\fBsubwin\\fP\nreturns an error if the parent window pointer is null, or\nif any of its ordinates or dimensions is negative, or\nif the resulting window does not fit inside the parent window.\n.PP\nThe functions which return a window pointer\nmay also fail if there is insufficient memory for its data structures.\nAny of these functions will fail if the screen has not been initialized,\ni.e., with \\fBinitscr\\fP or \\fBnewterm\\fP.\n.SH NOTES\nIf many small changes are made to the window, the \\fBwsyncup\\fP option could\ndegrade performance.\n.PP\nNote that \\fBsyncok\\fP may be a macro.\n.SH BUGS\nThe subwindow functions (\\fBsubwin\\fP, \\fBderwin\\fP, \\fBmvderwin\\fP,\n\\fBwsyncup\\fP, \\fBwsyncdown\\fP, \\fBwcursyncup\\fP, \\fBsyncok\\fP) are flaky,\nincompletely implemented, and not well tested.\n.PP\nThe System V curses documentation is very unclear about what \\fBwsyncup\\fP\nand \\fBwsyncdown\\fP actually do.\nIt seems to imply that they are only\nsupposed to touch exactly those lines that are affected by ancestor changes.\nThe language here, and the behavior of the \\fBcurses\\fP implementation,\nis patterned on the XPG4 curses standard.\nThe weaker XPG4 spec may result in slower updates.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nThe XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.\n.PP\nX/Open Curses states regarding \\fBdelwin\\fP:\n.bP\nIt must delete subwindows before deleting their parent.\n.bP\nIf \\fBdelwin\\fP is asked to delete a parent window,\nit can only succeed if the curses library keeps a list of the subwindows.\nSVr4 curses kept a count of the number of subwindows rather than a list.\nIt simply returned \\fBERR\\fP when asked to delete a subwindow.\nSolaris X/Open curses does not even make that check,\nand will delete a parent window which still has subwindows.\n.bP\nSince release 4.0 (1996), ncurses maintains a list of windows for each screen,\nto ensure that a window has no subwindows before allowing deletion.\n.bP\nNetBSD copied this feature of ncurses in 2003.\n.br\nPDCurses follows the scheme used in Solaris X/Open curses.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_initscr\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_refresh\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_touch\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_variables\\fP(3X)\n",
