NAME\n\\fB@CLEAR@\\fP \\- clear the terminal screen\n.SH SYNOPSIS\n\\fB@CLEAR@\\fR [\\fB\\-T\\fItype\\fR] [\\fB\\-V\\fR] [\\fB\\-x\\fR]\n.br\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n\\fB@CLEAR@\\fP clears your terminal's screen if this is possible,\nincluding the terminal's scrollback buffer\n(if the extended \\*(``E3\\*('' capability is defined).\n\\fB@CLEAR@\\fP looks in the environment for the terminal type\ngiven by the environment variable \\fBTERM\\fP,\nand then in the\n\\fBterminfo\\fP database to determine how to clear the screen.\n.PP\n\\fB@CLEAR@\\fP writes to the standard output.\nYou can redirect the standard output to a file (which prevents\n\\fB@CLEAR@\\fP from actually clearing the screen),\nand later \\fBcat\\fP the file to the screen, clearing it at that point.\n.SH OPTIONS\n.PP\n.TP 5\n.B \\-T \\fItype\\fP\nindicates the \\fItype\\fP of terminal.\nNormally this option is\nunnecessary, because the default is taken from the environment\nvariable \\fBTERM\\fP.\nIf \\fB\\-T\\fP is specified, then the shell\nvariables \\fBLINES\\fP and \\fBCOLUMNS\\fP will also be ignored.\n.TP\n.B \\-V\nreports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.\nThe options are as follows:\n.TP\n.B \\-x\ndo not attempt to clear the terminal's scrollback buffer\nusing the extended \\*(``E3\\*('' capability.\n.SH HISTORY\nA \\fBclear\\fP command appeared in 2.79BSD dated February 24, 1979.\nLater that was provided in Unix 8th edition (1985).\n.PP\nAT&T adapted a different BSD program (\\fBtset\\fP) to make\na new command (\\fBtput\\fP),\nand used this to replace the \\fBclear\\fP command with a shell script\nwhich calls \\fBtput clear\\fP, e.g.,\n.NS\n/usr/bin/tput ${1:+-T$1} clear 2> /dev/null\nexit\n.NE\n.PP\nIn 1989, when Keith Bostic revised the BSD \\fBtput\\fP command\nto make it similar to the AT&T \\fBtput\\fP,\nhe added a shell script for the \\fBclear\\fP command:\n.NS\nexec tput clear\n.NE\n.PP\nThe remainder of the script in each case is a copyright notice.\n.PP\nThe ncurses \\fBclear\\fP command began in 1995 by adapting the original\nBSD \\fBclear\\fP command (with terminfo, of course).\n.PP\nThe \\fBE3\\fP extension came later:\n.bP\nIn June 1999, \\fBxterm\\fP provided an extension to the standard control\nsequence for clearing the screen.\nRather than clearing just the visible part of the screen using\n.NS\nprintf '\\\\033[2J'\n.NE\n.IP\none could clear the \\fIscrollback\\fP using\n.NS\nprintf '\\\\033[\\fB3\\fPJ'\n.NE\n.IP\nThis is documented in \\fIXTerm Control Sequences\\fP as a feature originating\nwith \\fBxterm\\fP.\n.bP\nA few other terminal developers adopted the feature, e.g., PuTTY in 2006.\n.bP\nIn April 2011, a Red Hat developer submitted a patch to the Linux\nkernel, modifying its console driver to do the same thing.\nThe Linux change, part of the 3.0 release, did not mention \\fBxterm\\fP,\nalthough it was cited in the Red Hat bug report (#683733)\nwhich led to the change.\n.bP\nAgain, a few other terminal developers adopted the feature.\nBut the\nnext relevant step was a change to the \\fBclear\\fP program in 2013\nto incorporate this extension.\n.bP\nIn 2013, the \\fBE3\\fP extension was overlooked in \\fB@TPUT@\\fP with\nthe \\*(``clear\\*('' parameter.\nThat was addressed in 2016 by reorganizing \\fB@TPUT@\\fP to share\nits logic with \\fB@CLEAR@\\fP and \\fB@TSET@\\fP.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nNeither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open  Group  Base  Specifications  Issue  7\n(POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents @TSET@ or @RESET@.\n.PP\nThe latter documents \\fBtput\\fP, which could be used to replace this utility\neither via a shell script or by an alias (such as a symbolic link) to\nrun \\fB@TPUT@\\fP as \\fB@CLEAR@\\fP.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n\\fB@TPUT@\\fP(1), \\fBterminfo\\fP(\\*n), \\fBxterm\\fP(1).\n.PP\nThis describes \\fBncurses\\fP\nversion @NCURSES_MAJOR@.@NCURSES_MINOR@ (patch @NCURSES_PATCH@).\n",
