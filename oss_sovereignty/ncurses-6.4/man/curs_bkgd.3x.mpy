\\fBwbkgdset\\fP routines\nset the \\fIbackground\\fP for a window.\nA window's background is a \\fBchtype\\fP consisting of\nany combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and a character:\n.bP\nThe attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed) with all non-blank\ncharacters that are written into the window with \\fBwaddch\\fP.\n.bP\nBoth the character and attribute parts of the background are combined with\nblank characters that are written into the window.\n.PP\nThe background becomes a property of each\ncharacter and moves with the character through any scrolling and\ninsert/delete line/character operations.\n.PP\nTo the extent possible on a particular terminal,\nthe attribute part of the background is displayed\nas the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.\n.SS bkgd\n.PP\nThe \\fBbkgd\\fP and \\fBwbkgd\\fP functions\nset the background property of the current or specified window\nand then apply this setting to every character position in that window.\nAccording to X/Open Curses, it should do this:\n.PP\n.bP\nThe rendition of every character on the screen is changed to\nthe new background rendition.\n.bP\nWherever the former background character\nappears, it is changed to the new background character.\n.PP\nNeither X/Open Curses nor the SVr4 manual pages give details about\nthe way the rendition of characters on the screen is updated when\n\\fBbkgd\\fP or \\fBwbkgd\\fP is used to change the background character.\n.PP\nThis implementation, like SVr4 curses, does not store the background\nand window attribute contributions to each cell separately.\nIt updates the rendition by comparing the character, non-color attributes and\ncolors contained in the background.\nFor each cell in the window, whether or not it is blank:\n.bP\nThe library first compares the \\fIcharacter\\fP,\nand if it matches the current character part of the background,\nit replaces that with the new background character.\n.IP\nWhen \\fBbkgdset\\fP is used to set the background character,\nthat does not update each cell in the window.\nA subsequent call to \\fBbkgd\\fP will only modify the \\fIcharacter\\fP in\ncells which match the current background character.\n.bP\nThe library then checks if the cell uses color,\ni.e., its color pair value is nonzero.\nIf not, it simply replaces the attributes and color pair in the\ncell with those from the new background character.\n.bP\nIf the cell uses color,\nand that matches the color in the current background,\nthe library removes attributes\nwhich may have come from the current background\nand adds attributes from the new background.\nIt finishes by setting the cell\nto use the color from the new background.\n.bP\nIf the cell uses color,\nand that does not match the color in the current background,\nthe library updates only the non-color attributes,\nfirst removing those which may have come from the current background,\nand then adding attributes from the new background.\n.PP\nIf the background's character value is zero (0), a space is assumed.\n.PP\nIf the terminal does not support color,\nor if color has not been started with \\fBstart_color\\fP,\nthe new background character's color attribute will be ignored.\n.SS getbkgd\n.PP\nThe \\fBgetbkgd\\fP function returns the given window's current background\ncharacter/attribute pair.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\n.PP\nThese functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.\nIt specifies that \\fBbkgd\\fP and \\fBwbkgd\\fP return \\fBERR\\fP on failure,\nbut gives no failure conditions.\n.PP\nThe routines \\fBbkgd\\fP and \\fBwbkgd\\fP return the integer \\fBOK\\fP,\nunless the library has not been initialized.\n.PP\nIn contrast,\nthe SVr4.0 manual says \\fBbkgd\\fP and \\fBwbkgd\\fP may return \\fBOK\\fP\n\"or a non-negative integer if \\fBimmedok\\fP is set\",\nwhich refers to the return value from \\fBwrefresh\\fP\n(used to implement the immediate repainting).\nThe SVr4 curses \\fBwrefresh\\fP returns the number of characters\nwritten to the screen during the refresh.\nThis implementation does not do that.\n.SH NOTES\n.PP\nNote that \\fBbkgdset\\fP and \\fBbkgd\\fP may be macros.\n.PP\nX/Open Curses mentions that the character part of the background must\nbe a single-byte value.\nThis implementation, like SVr4, checks to ensure that,\nand will reuse the old background character if the check fails.\n.SH PORTABILITY\n.PP\nThese functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4\n(X/Open Curses).\n.SH SEE
