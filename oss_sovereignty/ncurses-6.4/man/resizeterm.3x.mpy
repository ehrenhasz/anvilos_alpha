NAME\n\\fBis_term_resized\\fP,\n\\fBresize_term\\fP,\n\\fBresizeterm\\fP \\- change the curses terminal size\n.SH SYNOPSIS\n\\fB#include <curses.h>\\fP\n.sp\n\\fBbool is_term_resized(int \\fIlines\\fB, int \\fIcolumns\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n\\fBint resize_term(int \\fIlines\\fB, int \\fIcolumns\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n\\fBint resizeterm(int \\fIlines\\fB, int \\fIcolumns\\fB);\\fR\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n.PP\nThis is an extension to the curses library.\nIt provides callers with a hook into the \\fBncurses\\fP data to resize windows,\nprimarily for use by programs running in an X Window terminal (e.g., xterm)\nwhen the terminal's screen size is changed by the user:\n.bP\nCurses windows cannot extend outside the screen.\nIf the terminal is shrunk, curses windows must be shrunk to fit.\n.bP\nIf the terminal is stretched,\nrows and/or columns can be added to existing windows.\nThe added cells should match the current attributes of the windows.\n.PP\nIf the calling program has not set up a handler for \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP\nwhen it initializes \\fBncurses\\fP\n(e.g., using \\fBinitscr\\fP(3X) or \\fBnewterm\\fP(3X)),\nthen \\fBncurses\\fP sets a handler for \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP which notifies\nthe library when a window-size event has occurred.\nThe library checks for this notification\n.bP\nwhen reading input data,\n.bP\nwhen implicitly resuming program mode\n(e.g., between \\fBendwin\\fP(3X) and \\fBwrefresh\\fP(3X)),\nand\n.bP\nwhen explicitly resuming program mode in \\fBrestartterm\\fP(3X).\n.PP\nWhen the library has found that the terminal's window-size has\nchanged, it calls \\fBresizeterm\\fP to update its data structures.\n.PP\nAn application which establishes its own \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP handler\ncan call \\fBresizeterm\\fP, but in that case, the library will not\nsee \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP, and proper layout will rely upon the application.\n.SH FUNCTIONS\n.SS resizeterm\n.PP\nThe function \\fBresizeterm\\fP resizes the standard and current windows\n(i.e., \\fBstdscr\\fP and \\fBcurscr\\fP)\nto the specified dimensions, and adjusts other bookkeeping data used by\nthe \\fBncurses\\fP library that record the window dimensions\nsuch as the \\fBLINES\\fP and \\fBCOLS\\fP variables.\n.SS resize_term\n.PP\nMost of the work for \\fBresizeterm\\fP is\ndone by the inner function \\fBresize_term\\fP.\nThe outer function \\fBresizeterm\\fP adds bookkeeping\nfor the \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP handler,\nas well as repainting the soft-key area (see \\fBslk_touch\\fP(3X)).\n.PP\nThe \\fBresize_term\\fP function attempts to resize all windows.\nThis helps with simple applications.\nHowever:\n.bP\nIt is not possible to automatically resize pads.\n.bP\nApplications which have complicated layouts should check for\n\\fBKEY_RESIZE\\fP returned from \\fBwgetch\\fP,\nand adjust their layout, e.g., using \\fBwresize\\fP and \\fBmvwin\\fP,\nor by recreating the windows.\n.PP\nWhen resizing windows, \\fBresize_term\\fP recursively adjusts subwindows,\nkeeping them within the updated parent window's limits.\nIf a top-level window happens to extend to the screen's limits,\nthen on resizing the window, \\fBresize_term\\fP will keep the window\nextending to the corresponding limit, regardless of whether the\nscreen has shrunk or grown.\n.SS is_term_resized\n.PP\nA support function \\fBis_term_resized\\fP is provided so that applications\ncan check if the \\fBresize_term\\fP function would modify the window structures.\nIt returns \\fBTRUE\\fP if the windows would be modified,\nand \\fBFALSE\\fP otherwise.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nExcept as noted, these functions return\nthe integer \\fBERR\\fP upon failure and \\fBOK\\fP on success.\nThey will fail if either of the dimensions are less than or equal to zero,\nor if an error occurs while (re)allocating memory for the windows.\n.SH NOTES\nWhile these functions are intended to be used to support a signal handler\n(i.e., for \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP), care should be taken to avoid invoking them in a\ncontext where \\fBmalloc\\fP or \\fBrealloc\\fP may have been interrupted,\nsince it uses those functions.\n.PP\nIf ncurses is configured to supply its own \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP handler,\n.bP\non receipt of a \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP, the handler sets a flag\n.bP\nwhich is tested in\n\\fBwgetch\\fP(3X),\n\\fBdoupdate\\fP(3X) and\n\\fBrestartterm\\fP(3X),\n.bP\nin turn, calling the \\fBresizeterm\\fP function,\n.bP\nwhich \\fBungetch\\fP's a \\fBKEY_RESIZE\\fP which\nwill be read on the next call to \\fBwgetch\\fP.\n.IP\nThe \\fBKEY_RESIZE\\fP alerts an application that the screen size has changed,\nand that it should repaint special features such as pads that cannot\nbe done automatically.\n.IP\nCalling \\fBresizeterm\\fP or \\fBresize_term\\fP\ndirectly from a signal handler is unsafe.\nThis indirect method is used to provide a safe way to resize the ncurses\ndata structures.\n.PP\nIf the environment variables \\fBLINES\\fP or \\fBCOLUMNS\\fP are set,\nthis overrides the library's use of the window size obtained from\nthe operating system.\nThus, even if a \\fBSIGWINCH\\fP is received,\nno screen size change may be recorded.\n.SH PORTABILITY\n.PP\nIt is possible to resize the screen with SVr4 curses,\nby\n.bP\nexiting curses with \\fBendwin\\fP(3X) and\n.bP\nresuming using \\fBrefresh\\fP(3X).\n.PP\nDoing that clears the screen and is visually distracting.\n.PP\nThis extension of ncurses was introduced in mid-1995.\nIt was adopted in NetBSD curses (2001) and PDCurses (2003).\n.SH SEE
