SYNOPSIS\n\\*d/*/*\n.SH DESCRIPTION\n.I Terminfo\nis a database describing terminals,\nused by screen-oriented programs such as\n\\fBnvi\\fP(1),\n\\fBlynx\\fP(1),\n\\fBmutt\\fP(1),\nand other curses applications,\nusing high-level calls to libraries such as \\fBcurses\\fP(3X).\nIt is also used via low-level calls by non-curses applications\nwhich may be screen-oriented (such as \\fB@CLEAR@\\fP(1))\nor non-screen (such as \\fB@TABS@\\fP(1)).\n.PP\n.I Terminfo\ndescribes terminals by giving a set of capabilities which they\nhave, by specifying how to perform screen operations, and by\nspecifying padding requirements and initialization sequences.\n.PP\nThis manual describes \\fBncurses\\fP\nversion @NCURSES_MAJOR@.@NCURSES_MINOR@ (patch @NCURSES_PATCH@).\n.SS Terminfo Entry Syntax\n.PP\nEntries in\n.I terminfo\nconsist of a sequence of fields:\n.bP\nEach field ends with a comma \\*(``,\\*(''\n(embedded commas may be\nescaped with a backslash or written as \\*(``\\\\054\\*('').\n.bP\nWhite space between fields is ignored.\n.bP\nThe first field in a \\fIterminfo\\fP entry begins in the first column.\n.bP\nNewlines and leading whitespace (spaces or tabs)\nmay be used for formatting entries for readability.\nThese are removed from parsed entries.\n.IP\nThe \\fB@INFOCMP@\\fP \\fB\\-f\\fP and \\fB\\-W\\fP options rely on this to\nformat if-then-else expressions,\nor to enforce maximum line-width.\nThe resulting formatted terminal description can be read by \\fB@TIC@\\fP.\n.bP\nThe first field for each terminal gives the names which are known for the\nterminal, separated by \\*(``|\\*('' characters.\n.IP\nThe first name given is the most common abbreviation for the terminal\n(its primary name),\nthe last name given should be a long name fully identifying the terminal\n(see \\fBlongname\\fP(3X)),\nand all others are treated as synonyms (aliases) for the primary terminal name.\n.IP\nX/Open Curses advises that all names but the last should be in lower case\nand contain no blanks;\nthe last name may well contain upper case and blanks for readability.\n.IP\nThis implementation is not so strict;\nit allows mixed case in the primary name and aliases.\nIf the last name has no embedded blanks,\nit allows that to be both an alias and a verbose name\n(but will warn about this ambiguity).\n.bP\nLines beginning with a \\*(``#\\*('' in the first column are treated as comments.\n.IP\nWhile comment lines are legal at any point, the output of \\fB@CAPTOINFO@\\fP\nand \\fB@INFOTOCAP@\\fP (aliases for \\fB@TIC@\\fP)\nwill move comments so they occur only between entries.\n.PP\nTerminal names (except for the last, verbose entry) should\nbe chosen using the following conventions.\nThe particular piece of hardware making up the terminal should\nhave a root name, thus \\*(``hp2621\\*(''.\nThis name should not contain hyphens.\nModes that the hardware can be in, or user preferences, should\nbe indicated by appending a hyphen and a mode suffix.\nThus, a vt100 in 132-column mode would be vt100\\-w.\nThe following suffixes should be used where possible:\n.PP\n.TS\ncenter ;\nl c l\nl l l.\n\\fBSuffix\tMeaning\tExample\\fP\n\\-\\fInn\\fP\tNumber of lines on the screen\taaa\\-60\n\\-\\fIn\\fPp\tNumber of pages of memory\tc100\\-4p\n\\-am\tWith automargins (usually the default)\tvt100\\-am\n\\-m\tMono mode; suppress color       \tansi\\-m\n\\-mc\tMagic cookie; spaces when highlighting\twy30\\-mc\n\\-na\tNo arrow keys (leave them in local)\tc100\\-na\n\\-nam\tWithout automatic margins       \tvt100\\-nam\n\\-nl\tNo status line                  \tatt4415\\-nl\n\\-ns\tNo status line                  \thp2626\\-ns\n\\-rv\tReverse video                   \tc100\\-rv\n\\-s\tEnable status line              \tvt100\\-s\n\\-vb\tUse visible bell instead of beep\twy370\\-vb\n\\-w\tWide mode (> 80 columns, usually 132)\tvt100\\-w\n.TE\n.PP\nFor more on terminal naming conventions, see the \\fBterm\\fP(7) manual page.\n.SS Terminfo Capabilities Syntax\n.PP\nThe terminfo entry consists of several \\fIcapabilities\\fP,\ni.e., features that the terminal has,\nor methods for exercising the terminal's features.\n.PP\nAfter the first field (giving the name(s) of the terminal entry),\nthere should be one or more \\fIcapability\\fP fields.\nThese are boolean, numeric or string names with corresponding values:\n.bP\nBoolean capabilities are true when present, false when absent.\nThere is no explicit value for boolean capabilities.\n.bP\nNumeric capabilities have a \\*(``#\\*('' following the name,\nthen an unsigned decimal integer value.\n.bP\nString capabilities have a \\*(``=\\*('' following the name,\nthen an string of characters making up the capability value.\n.IP\nString capabilities can be split into multiple lines,\njust as the fields comprising a terminal entry can be\nsplit into multiple lines.\nWhile blanks between fields are ignored,\nblanks embedded within a string value are retained,\nexcept for leading blanks on a line.\n.PP\nAny capability can be \\fIcanceled\\fP,\ni.e., suppressed from the terminal entry,\nby following its name with \\*(``@\\*(''\nrather than a capability value.\n.SS Similar Terminals\n.PP\nIf there are two very similar terminals, one (the variant) can be defined as\nbeing just like the other (the base) with certain exceptions.\nIn the\ndefinition of the variant, the string capability \\fBuse\\fP can be given with\nthe name of the base terminal:\n.bP\nThe capabilities given before\n.B use\noverride those in the base type named by\n.BR use .\n.bP\nIf there are multiple \\fBuse\\fP capabilities, they are merged in reverse order.\nThat is, the rightmost \\fBuse\\fP reference is processed first, then the one to\nits left, and so forth.\n.bP\nCapabilities given explicitly in the entry override\nthose brought in by \\fBuse\\fP references.\n.PP\nA capability can be canceled by placing \\fBxx@\\fP to the left of the\nuse reference that imports it, where \\fIxx\\fP is the capability.\nFor example, the entry\n.RS\n.PP\n2621\\-nl, smkx@, rmkx@, use=2621,\n.RE\n.PP\ndefines a 2621\\-nl that does not have the \\fBsmkx\\fP or \\fBrmkx\\fP capabilities,\nand hence does not turn on the function key labels when in visual mode.\nThis is useful for different modes for a terminal, or for different\nuser preferences.\n.PP\nAn entry included via \\fBuse\\fP can contain canceled capabilities,\nwhich have the same effect as if those cancels were inline in the\nusing terminal entry.\n.SS Predefined Capabilities\n.\\\" Head of terminfo man page ends here\n.ps -1\n",
