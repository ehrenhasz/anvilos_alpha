\\fInlines\\fP, and columns,\n\\fIncols\\fP.\nA pad is like a window, except that it is not restricted by the\nscreen size, and is not necessarily associated with a particular part of the\nscreen.\nPads can be used when a large window is needed, and only a part of the\nwindow will be on the screen at one time.\nAutomatic refreshes of pads\n(e.g., from scrolling or echoing of input) do not occur.\n.PP\nIt is not\nlegal to call \\fBwrefresh\\fP with a \\fIpad\\fP as an argument; the routines\n\\fBprefresh\\fP or \\fBpnoutrefresh\\fP should be called instead.\nNote that these\nroutines require additional parameters to specify the part of the pad to be\ndisplayed and the location on the screen to be used for the display.\n.SS subpad\n.PP\nThe \\fBsubpad\\fP routine creates and returns a pointer to a subwindow within a\npad with the given number of lines, \\fInlines\\fP, and columns, \\fIncols\\fP.\nUnlike \\fBsubwin\\fP, which uses screen coordinates, the window is at position\n(\\fIbegin\\fR_\\fIx\\fB,\\fR \\fIbegin\\fR_\\fIy\\fR) on the pad.\nThe window is\nmade in the middle of the window \\fIorig\\fP, so that changes made to one window\naffect both windows.\nDuring the use of this routine, it will often be\nnecessary to call \\fBtouchwin\\fP or \\fBtouchline\\fP on \\fIorig\\fP before\ncalling \\fBprefresh\\fP.\n.SS prefresh, pnoutrefresh\n.PP\nThe \\fBprefresh\\fP and \\fBpnoutrefresh\\fP routines are analogous to\n\\fBwrefresh\\fP and \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP except that they relate to pads instead\nof windows.\nThe additional parameters are needed to indicate what part of the\npad and screen are involved.\n.bP\nThe \\fIpminrow\\fP and \\fIpmincol\\fP parameters specify the upper\nleft-hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad.\n.bP\nThe \\fIsminrow\\fP,\n\\fIsmincol\\fP, \\fIsmaxrow\\fP, and \\fIsmaxcol\\fP\nparameters specify the edges of the\nrectangle to be displayed on the screen.\n.PP\nThe lower right-hand corner of the\nrectangle to be displayed in the pad is calculated from the screen coordinates,\nsince the rectangles must be the same size.\nBoth rectangles must be entirely\ncontained within their respective structures.\nNegative values of\n\\fIpminrow\\fP, \\fIpmincol\\fP, \\fIsminrow\\fP, or \\fIsmincol\\fP are treated as if\nthey were zero.\n.SS pechochar\n.PP\nThe \\fBpechochar\\fP routine is functionally equivalent to a call to \\fBaddch\\fP\nfollowed by a call to \\fBrefresh\\fP(3X),\na call to \\fBwaddch\\fP followed by a call\nto \\fBwrefresh\\fP, or a call to \\fBwaddch\\fP followed by a call to\n\\fBprefresh\\fP.\nThe knowledge that only a single character is being output is\ntaken into consideration and, for non-control characters, a considerable\nperformance gain might be seen by using these routines instead of their\nequivalents.\nIn the case of \\fBpechochar\\fP, the last location of the pad on\nthe screen is reused for the arguments to \\fBprefresh\\fP.\n.SS pecho_wchar\n.PP\nThe \\fBpecho_wchar\\fP function is the analogous wide-character\nform of \\fBpechochar\\fP.\nIt outputs one character to a pad and immediately refreshes the pad.\nIt does this by a call to \\fBwadd_wch\\fP followed by a call to \\fBprefresh\\fP.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nRoutines that return an integer return \\fBERR\\fP upon failure and \\fBOK\\fP\n(SVr4 only specifies \"an integer value other than \\fBERR\\fP\") upon successful\ncompletion.\n.PP\nRoutines that return pointers return \\fBNULL\\fP on error, and set \\fBerrno\\fP\nto \\fBENOMEM\\fP.\n.PP\nX/Open does not define any error conditions.\nIn this implementation\n.RS 3\n.TP 5\n\\fBprefresh\\fP and \\fBpnoutrefresh\\fP\nreturn an error\nif the window pointer is null, or\nif the window is not really a pad or\nif the area to refresh extends off-screen or\nif the minimum coordinates are greater than the maximum.\n.TP 5\n\\fBpechochar\\fP\nreturns an error\nif the window is not really a pad, and the associated call\nto \\fBwechochar\\fP returns an error.\n.TP 5\n\\fBpecho_wchar\\fP\nreturns an error\nif the window is not really a pad, and the associated call\nto \\fBwecho_wchar\\fP returns an error.\n.RE\n.SH NOTES\nNote that \\fBpechochar\\fP may be a macro.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nBSD curses has no \\fIpad\\fP feature.\n.PP\nSVr2 curses (1986) provided the \\fBnewpad\\fP and related functions,\ndocumenting them in a single line each.\nSVr3 (1987) provided more extensive documentation.\n.PP\nThe documentation does not explain the term \\fIpad\\fP.\nHowever, the Apollo \\fIAegis\\fP workstation operating system\nsupported a graphical \\fIpad\\fP feature:\n.bP\nThese graphical pads could be much larger than the computer's display.\n.bP\nThe read-only output from a command could be scrolled back to inspect,\nand select text from the pad.\n.PP\nThe two uses may be related.\n.PP\nThe XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions,\nwithout significant change from the SVr3 documentation.\nIt describes no error conditions.\nThe behavior of \\fBsubpad\\fP if the parent window is not\na pad is undocumented,\nand is not checked by the vendor Unix implementations:\n.bP\nSVr4 curses sets a flag in the \\fBWINDOW\\fP structure in \\fBnewpad\\fP\nwhich tells if the window is a \\fIpad\\fP.\n.IP\nHowever, it uses this information only in\n\\fBwaddch\\fP (to decide if it should call \\fBwrefresh\\fP) and\n\\fBwscrl\\fP (to avoid scrolling a pad),\nand does not check in \\fBwrefresh\\fP to ensure that the pad\nis refreshed properly.\n.bP\nSolaris X/Open Curses checks if a window is a pad in \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP,\nreturning \\fBERR\\fP in that case.\n.IP\nHowever, it only sets the flag for subwindows if the parent window is a pad.\nIts \\fBnewpad\\fP function does not set this information.\nConsequently, the check will never fail.\n.IP\nIt makes no comparable check in \\fBpnoutrefresh\\fP,\nthough interestingly enough, a comment in the source code\nstates that the lack of a check was an MKS extension.\n.bP\nNetBSD 7 curses\nsets a flag in the \\fBWINDOW\\fP structure for \\fBnewpad\\fP and \\fBsubpad\\fP,\nusing this to help with the distinction between \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP\nand \\fBpnoutrefresh\\fP.\n.IP\nIt does not check for the case where a subwindow is created in\na pad using \\fBsubwin\\fP or \\fBderwin\\fP.\n.IP\nThe \\fBdupwin\\fP function returns a regular window when duplicating a pad.\nLikewise, \\fBgetwin\\fP always returns a window, even if the saved\ndata was from a pad.\n.PP\nThis implementation\n.bP\nsets a flag in the \\fBWINDOW\\fP structure for \\fBnewpad\\fP and \\fBsubpad\\fP,\n.bP\nallows a \\fBsubwin\\fP or \\fBderwin\\fP call to succeed having a pad parent by\nforcing the subwindow to be a pad,\n.bP\nchecks in both \\fBwnoutrefresh\\fP and \\fBpnoutrefresh\\fP to ensure\nthat pads and windows are handled distinctly, and\n.bP\nensures that \\fBdupwin\\fP and \\fBgetwin\\fP treat\npads versus windows consistently.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_refresh\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_touch\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_addch\\fP(3X).\n",
