NAME\n\\fBset_field_opts\\fP,\n\\fBfield_opts_on\\fP,\n\\fBfield_opts_off\\fP,\n\\fBfield_opts\\fP \\- set and get field options\n.SH SYNOPSIS\n\\fB#include <form.h>\\fP\n.sp\n\\fBint set_field_opts(FIELD *\\fIfield\\fB, Field_Options \\fIopts\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n\\fBField_Options field_opts(const FIELD *\\fIfield\\fB);\\fR\n.sp\n\\fBint field_opts_on(FIELD *\\fIfield\\fB, Field_Options \\fIopts\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n\\fBint field_opts_off(FIELD *\\fIfield\\fB, Field_Options \\fIopts\\fB);\\fR\n.br\n.SH DESCRIPTION\nThe function \\fBset_field_opts\\fP sets all the given field's option bits (field\noption bits may be logically-OR'ed together).\n.PP\nThe function \\fBfield_opts_on\\fP turns on the given option bits, and leaves\nothers alone.\n.PP\nThe function \\fBfield_opts_off\\fP turns off the given option bits, and leaves\nothers alone.\n.PP\nThe function \\fBfield_opts\\fP returns the field's current option bits.\n.PP\nThe following standard options are defined (all are on by default):\n.TP 5\nO_ACTIVE\nThe field is visited during processing.\nIf this option is off, the field will\nnot be reachable by navigation keys.\nPlease notice that an invisible field\nappears to be inactive also.\n.TP 5\nO_AUTOSKIP\nSkip to the next field when this one fills.\n.TP 5\nO_BLANK\nThe field is cleared whenever a character is entered at the first position.\n.TP 5\nO_EDIT\nThe field can be edited.\n.TP 5\nO_NULLOK\nAllow a blank field.\n.TP 5\nO_PASSOK\nValidate field only if modified by user.\n.TP 5\nO_PUBLIC\nThe field contents are displayed as data is entered.\n.TP 5\nO_STATIC\nField buffers are fixed to field's original size.\nTurn this option off to create a dynamic field.\n.TP 5\nO_VISIBLE\nThe field is displayed.\nIf this option is off, display of the field is\nsuppressed.\n.TP 5\nO_WRAP\nWords that do not fit on a line are wrapped to the next line.\nWords are\nblank-separated.\n.PP\nThese extension options are defined (extensions are off by default):\n.TP 5\nO_DYNAMIC_JUSTIFY\nPermit dynamic fields to be justified, like static fields.\n.TP 5\nO_NO_LEFT_STRIP\nPreserve leading whitespace in the field buffer, which is normally discarded.\n.TP 5\nO_EDGE_INSERT_STAY\nWhen inserting into a field up to the boundary position,\noptionally delay the scrolling,\nso that the last inserted character remains visible,\nbut advance the cursor to reflect the insertion.\nThis allows the form library to display the\ninserted character in one-character fields\nas well as allowing the library to maintain consistent state.\n.TP 5\nO_INPUT_FIELD\nThe \\fBset_max_field\\fP function checks for this extension,\nwhich allows a dynamic field to shrink if the new\nlimit is smaller than the current field size.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nExcept for \\fBfield_opts\\fP, each routine returns one of the following:\n.TP 5\n.B E_OK\nThe routine succeeded.\n.TP 5\n.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT\nRoutine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.\n.TP 5\n.B E_CURRENT\nThe field is the current field.\n.TP 5\n.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR\nSystem error occurred (see \\fBerrno\\fP(3)).\n.SH SEE ALSO\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X),\n\\fBform\\fP(3X).\n\\fBform_field_just\\fP(3X).\n.SH NOTES\nThe header file \\fB<form.h>\\fP automatically includes the header file\n\\fB<curses.h>\\fP.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nThese routines emulate the System V forms library.\nThey were not supported on\nVersion 7 or BSD versions.\n.SH AUTHORS\nJuergen Pfeifer.\nManual pages and adaptation for new curses by
