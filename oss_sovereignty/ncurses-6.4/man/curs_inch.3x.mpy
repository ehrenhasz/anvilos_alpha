it is implementation-dependent.\nThis implementation uses 8 bits for character values.\nAn application using more bits, e.g., a Unicode value,\nshould use the wide-character equivalents to these functions.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n.TP 5\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X)\ngives an overview of the WINDOW and \\fBchtype\\fP data types.\n.TP 5\n\\fBcurs_attr\\fP(3X)\ngoes into more detail, pointing out portability problems and\nconstraints on the use of \\fBchtype\\fP for returning window information.\n.TP 5\n\\fBcurs_in_wch\\fP(3X)\ndescribes comparable functions for the wide-character (ncursesw) library.\n",
