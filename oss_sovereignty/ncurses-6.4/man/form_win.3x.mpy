A form argument of \\fBNULL\\fP is treated as a request\nto change the system default form window or subwindow.\n.PP\nThe function \\fBscale_form\\fP returns the minimum size required for the\nsubwindow of \\fIform\\fP.\n.SH RETURN VALUE\nRoutines that return pointers return \\fBNULL\\fP on error.\nRoutines that return\nan integer return one of the following error codes:\n.TP 5\n.B E_OK\nThe routine succeeded.\n.TP 5\n.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR\nSystem error occurred (see \\fBerrno\\fP(3)).\n.TP 5\n.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT\nRoutine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.\n.TP 5\n.B E_POSTED\nThe form has already been posted.\n.TP 5\n.B E_NOT_CONNECTED\nNo items are connected to the form.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n\\fBcurses\\fP(3X),\n\\fBcurs_variables\\fP(3X),\n\\fBform\\fP(3X).\n.SH NOTES\nThe header file \\fB<form.h>\\fP automatically includes the header file\n\\fB<curses.h>\\fP.\n.SH PORTABILITY\nThese routines emulate the System V forms library.\nThey were not supported on\nVersion 7 or BSD versions.\n.SH AUTHORS\nJuergen Pfeifer.\nManual pages and adaptation for new curses by Eric S.
