Dickey (TD).\n#\n# Report bugs and new terminal descriptions to\n#\tbug-ncurses@gnu.org\n#\n#\t$Revision: 1.1041 $\n#\t$Date: 2022/12/29 20:11:56 $\n#\n# The original header is preserved below for reference.  It is noted that there\n# is a \"newer\" version which differs in some cosmetic details (but actually\n# stopped updates several years ago); we have decided to not change the header\n# unless there is also a change in content.\n#\n# To further muddy the waters, it is noted that changes to this file as part of\n# maintenance of ncurses (since 1996) are generally conceded to be copyright\n# under the ncurses MIT-style license.  That was the effect of the agreement\n# which the principal authors of ncurses made in 1998.  However, since much of\n# the file itself is of unknown authorship (and the disclaimer below makes it\n# obvious that Raymond cannot or will not convey rights over those parts),\n# there is no explicit copyright notice on the file itself.\n#\n# It would also be a nuisance to split the file into unknown/known authorship\n# and move pieces as they are maintained, since many of the maintenance changes\n# have been small corrections to Raymond's translations to/from termcap format,\n# correcting the data but not the accompanying annotations.\n#\n# In any case, note that almost half of this file is not data but annotations\n# which reflect creative effort.  Furthermore, the structure of entries to\n# reuse common chunks also is creative (and subject to copyright).  Finally,\n# some portions of the data are derivative work under a compatible MIT-style\n# license from xterm.\n#\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#terminfo_copying\n# https://invisible-island.net/personal/copyrights.html#removing_notes\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n#\tVersion 10.2.1\n#\tterminfo syntax\n#\n#\tEric S. Raymond\t\t(current maintainer)\n#\tJohn Kunze, Berkeley\n#\tCraig Leres, Berkeley\n#\n# Please e-mail changes to terminfo@thyrsus.com; the old termcap@berkeley.edu\n# address is no longer valid.  The latest version can always be found at\n# <http://www.tuxedo.org/terminfo>.\n#\n# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:\n#\n# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,\n# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.\n#\n# Other terminfo and termcap files exist, supported by various OS vendors\n# or as relics of various older versions of UNIX.  This one is the longest\n# and most comprehensive one in existence.  It subsumes not only the entirety\n# of the historical 4.4BSD, GNU, System V and SCO termcap files and the BRL\n# termcap file, but also large numbers of vendor-maintained termcap and\n# terminfo entries more complete and carefully tested than those in historical\n# termcap/terminfo versions.\n#\n# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may\n# be found at <http://www.tuxedo.org/terminfo>.\n#\n# INTERNATIONALIZATION:\n#\n# This file uses only the US-ASCII character set (no ISO8859 characters).\n#\n# This file assumes a US-ASCII character set. If you need to fix this, start\n# by global-replacing \\E(B and \\E)B with the appropriate ISO 6429 enablers\n# for your character set.  \\E(A and \\E)A enables the British character set\n# with the pound sign at position 2/3.\n#\n# In a Japanese-processing environment using EUC/Japanese or Shift-JIS,\n# C1 characters are considered the first-byte set of the Japanese encodings,\n# so \\E)0 should be avoided in <enacs> and initialization strings.\n#\n# FILE FORMAT:\n#\n# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master\n# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell\n# which by the format given in the header above.\n#\n# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the\n# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only\n# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to\n# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master\n# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed \"/OT[^,]*,/s///\"'; but if\n# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer (among other things, it automatically\n# outputs entries in a canonical form).\n#\n# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version\n# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their\n# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the 1023-byte\n# string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where explicitly\n# noted below.  Note that the termcap translation assumes that your termcap\n# library can handle multiple tc capabilities in an entry. 4.4BSD has this\n# capability.  Older versions of GNU termcap, through 1.3, do not.\n#\n# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,\n# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD\n# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources\n# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.\n#\n# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),\n# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation\n# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field\n# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).\n#\n# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor\n# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of\n# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered\n# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.\n#\n# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by\n# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information\n# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware\n# (notably DEC and Wyse).\n#\n# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.\n#\n# FILE ORGANIZATION:\n#\n# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle\n# of a terminfo/termcap entry (this feature had to be sacrificed in order\n# to allow standard terminfo and termcap syntax to be generated cleanly from\n# the master format).  Individual capabilities are commented out by\n# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.\n#\n# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with\n# the string \"########\") and minor sections (beginning with \"####\"); do\n#\n#\tgrep \"^####\" <file> | more\n#\n# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is\n# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so\n# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the\n# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency from a linear\n# search of the termcap form even if you don't use reorder).  Minor sections\n# usually correspond to manufacturers or standard terminal classes.\n# Parenthesized words following manufacturer names are type prefixes or\n# product line names used by that manufacturers.\n#\n# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:\n#\n# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or\n# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for\n# the terminal.\n#\n# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>\n# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the\n# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used\n# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,\n# or user preferences.\n#\n# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.\n#\n# The following are conventionally used suffixes:\n#\t-2p\tHas two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.\n#\t-am\tEnable auto-margin.\n#\t-m\tMonochrome.  Suppress color support\n#\t-mc\tMagic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can\n#\t\tonly support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.\n#\t\tTheir base entry is usually paired with another that\n#\t\tuses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.\n#\t-nam\tNo auto-margin - suppress <am> capability\n#\t-nl\tNo labels - suppress soft labels\n#\t-ns\tNo status line - suppress status line\n#\t-rv\tTerminal in reverse video mode (black on white)\n#\t-s\tEnable status line.\n#\t-vb\tUse visible bell (<flash>) rather than <bel>.\n#\t-w\tWide - in 132 column mode.\n# If a name has multiple suffixes and one is a line height, that one should\n# go first.  Thus `aaa-30-s-rv' is recommended over `aaa-s-rv-30'.\n#\n# Entries with embedded plus signs are designed to be included through use/tc\n# capabilities, not used as standalone entries.\n#\n# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have\n# been removed (i.e., \"33\" for the Model 33 Teletype, \"2621\" for the HP2621).\n# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.\n#\n# Comments marked \"esr\" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler\n# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages.\n# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the\n# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled\n# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original\n# entries is preserved in the comments.\n#\n# In the comments, terminfo capability names are bracketed with <> (angle\n# brackets).  Termcap capability names are bracketed with :: (colons).\n#\n# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES\n#\n# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string\n# capabilities for use by applications, <u0>...<u9>.   In this file, we use\n# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered\n# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:\n#\n#\tu9\tterminal enquire string (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 DA)\n#\tu8\tterminal answerback description\n#\tu7\tcursor position request (equiv. to VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48 DSR 6)\n#\tu6\tcursor position report (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 CPR)\n#\n# The terminal enquire string <u9> should elicit an answerback response\n# from the terminal.  Common values for <u9> will be ^E (on older ASCII\n# terminals) or \\E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).\n#\n# The cursor position request (<u7>) string should elicit a cursor position\n# report.  A typical value (for VT100 terminals) is \\E[6n.\n#\n# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected\n# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like\n# escapes:\n#\n#\t%c\tAccept any character\n#\t%[...]\tAccept any number of characters in the given set\n#\n# The cursor position report (<u6>) string must contain two scanf(3)-style\n# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate\n# and the second to the %d.  If the string contains the sequence %i, it is\n# taken as an instruction to decrement each value after reading it (this is\n# the inverse sense from the cup string).  The typical CPR value is\n# \\E[%i%d;%dR (on VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).\n#\n# These capabilities are used by tack(1m), the terminfo action checker\n# (distributed with ncurses 5.0).\n#\n# TABSET FILES\n#\n# All the entries in this file have been edited to assume that the tabset\n# files directory is /usr/share/tabset, in conformance with the File Hierarchy\n# Standard for Linux and open-source BSD systems.  Some vendors (notably Sun)\n# use /usr/lib/tabset or (more recently) /usr/share/lib/tabset.\n#\n# No curses package we know of actually uses these files.  If their location\n# is an issue, you will have to hand-patch the file locations before compiling\n# this file.\n#\n# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL\n#\n# As the ANSI/ECMA-48 standard and variants take firmer hold, and as\n# character-cell terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of\n# this file is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for\n# the new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, Unix consoles,\n# and vt100 up front in confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).\n#\n# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's\n# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).\n#\n# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of\n# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by\n# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to\n# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many\n# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years\n# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.\n#\n# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under\n# `Miscellaneous obsolete terminals, manufacturers unknown' before the tribal\n# wisdom about them gets lost.  If you know a lot about obscure old terminals,\n# please go to the terminfo resource page, grab the UFO file (ufo.ti), and\n# eyeball it for things you can identify and describe.\n#\n# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file\n# with this in mind and send me your annotations.\n#\n# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS\n#\n# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of\n# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.\n#\n# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.\n# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they\n# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file\n# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.\n#\n# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may\n# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous\n# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of\n# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.\n#\n# This file deliberately has no copyright.

Older DEC terminals\n# and micro consoles can be found in the `obsolete' section.  More details on\n# the relationship between the VT100 and ANSI X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 may be\n# found near the end of this file.\n#\n# Except where noted, these entries are DEC's official terminfos.\n# Contact Bill Hedberg <hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com> of Terminal Support\n# Engineering for more information.  Updated terminfos and termcaps\n# are kept available at ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/termcaps.\n#\n# In October 1995 DEC sold its terminals business, including the VT and Dorio\n# line and trademark, to SunRiver Data Systems.  SunRiver has since changed\n# its name to Boundless Technologies; see http://www.boundless.com.\n#\n\n# NOTE:  Any VT100 emulation, whether in hardware or software, almost\n# certainly includes what DEC called the `Level 1 editing extension' codes;\n# only the very oldest VT100s lacked these and there probably aren't any of\n# those left alive.  To capture these, use one of the VT102 entries.\n#\n# Note that the <xenl> glitch in vt100 is not quite the same as on the Concept,\n# since the cursor is left in a different position while in the\n# weird state (concept at beginning of next line, vt100 at end\n# of this line) so all versions of vi before 3.7 don't handle\n# <xenl> right on vt100. The correct way to handle <xenl> is when\n# you output the char in column 80, immediately output CR LF\n# and then assume you are in column 1 of the next line. If <xenl>\n# is on, am should be on too.\n#\n# I assume you have smooth scroll off or are at a slow enough baud\n# rate that it doesn't matter (1200? or less). Also this assumes\n# that you set auto-nl to \"on\", if you set it off use vt100-nam\n# below.\n#\n# The padding requirements listed here are guesses. It is strongly\n# recommended that xon/xoff be enabled, as this is assumed here.\n#\n# The vt100 uses <rs2> and <rf> rather than <is2>/<tbc>/<hts> because the\n# tab settings are in non-volatile memory and don't need to be\n# reset upon login. Also setting the number of columns glitches\n# the screen annoyingly. You can type \"reset\" to get them set.\n#\n# The VT100 series terminals have cursor (\"arrows\") keys which can operate\n# in two different modes: Cursor Mode and Application Mode.  Cursor Mode\n# is the reset state, and is assumed to be the normal state.  Application\n# Mode is the \"set\" state.  In Cursor Mode, the cursor keys transmit\n# \"Esc [ {code}\" sequences, conforming to ANSI standards.  In Application\n# Mode, the cursor keys transmit \"Esc O <code>\" sequences.  Application Mode\n# was provided primarily as an aid to the porting of VT52 applications.  It is\n# assumed that the cursor keys are normally in Cursor Mode, and expected that\n# applications such as vi will always transmit the <smkx> string.  Therefore,\n# the definitions for the cursor keys are made to match what the terminal\n# transmits after the <smkx> string is transmitted.  If the <smkx> string\n# is a null string or is not defined, then cursor keys are assumed to be in\n# \"Cursor Mode\", and the cursor keys definitions should match that assumption,\n# else the application may fail.  It is also expected that applications will\n# always transmit the <rmkx> string to the terminal before they exit.\n#\n# The VT100 series terminals have an auxiliary keypad, commonly referred to as\n# the \"Numeric Keypad\", because it is a cluster of numeric and function keys.\n# The Numeric Keypad which can operate in two different modes: Numeric Mode and\n# Application Mode.  Numeric Mode is the reset state, and is assumed to be\n# the normal state.  Application Mode is the \"set\" state.  In Numeric Mode,\n# the numeric and punctuation keys transmit ASCII 7-bit characters, and the\n# Enter key transmits the same as the Return key (Note: the Return key\n# can be configured to send either LF (\\015) or CR LF).  In Application Mode,\n# all the keypad keys transmit \"Esc O {code}\" sequences.  The PF1 - PF4 keys\n# always send the same \"Esc O {code}\" sequences.  It is assumed that the keypad\n# is normally in Numeric Mode.  If an application requires that the keypad be\n# in Application Mode then it is expected that the user, or the application,\n# will set the TERM environment variable to point to a terminfo entry which has\n# defined the <smkx> string to include the codes that switch the keypad into\n# Application Mode, and the terminfo entry will also define function key\n# fields to match the Application Mode control codes.  If the <smkx> string\n# is a null string or is not defined, then the keypad is assumed to be in\n# Numeric Mode.  If the <smkx> string switches the keypad into Application\n# Mode, it is expected that the <rmkx> string will contain the control codes\n# necessary to reset the keypad to \"Normal\" mode, and it is also expected that\n# applications which transmit the <smkx> string will also always transmit the\n# <rmkx> string to the terminal before they exit.\n#\n# Here's a diagram of the VT100 keypad keys with their bindings.\n# The top line is the name of the key (some DEC keyboards have the keys\n# labelled somewhat differently, like GOLD instead of PF1, but this is\n# the most \"official\" name).

Use \"nsterm-7-m\" and hope for the best.\n# You might also try \"nsterm-7\" and \"nsterm-old\" if you suspect your\n# version supports color.\n#\n# To determine the version of Terminal.app you're using by running:\n#\n#     echo \"$TERM_PROGRAM\" \"$TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION\"\n#\n# For Apple_Terminal v309+, use \"nsterm-256color\" (or \"nsterm-bce\")\n#\n# For Apple_Terminal v200+, use \"nsterm-16color\" (a.k.a. \"nsterm\")\n#\n# For Apple_Terminal v71+/v100+, use \"nsterm-bce\".\n#\n# For Apple_Terminal v51+, use \"nsterm-7-c\" or \"nsterm-7-c-s\".\n#\n# For Apple_Terminal v41+, use \"nsterm-old\", or \"nsterm-s\".\n#\n# For all earlier versions (Apple_Terminal), try \"nsterm-7-m\"\n# (monochrome) or \"nsterm-7\" (color); \"nsterm-7-m-s\" and \"nsterm-7-s\"\n# might work too, but really you're on your own here since these\n# systems are very obsolete and I can't test them. I do welcome\n# patches, though :).\n\n# Other Terminals:\n#\n# For GNUstep_Terminal, you're probably best off using \"linux\" or\n# writing your own terminfo.\n\n# For MacTelnet, you're on your own. It's a different codebase, and\n# seems to be somewhere between \"vt102\", \"ncsa\" and \"xterm-color\".\n\n# For iTerm.app, see \"iterm\".\n\n#\n# The AppKit Terminal.app descriptions all have names beginning with\n# \"nsterm\". Note that the statusline (-s) versions use the window\n# titlebar as a phony status line, and may produce warnings during\n# compilation as a result (\"tsl uses 0 parameters, expected 1\".)\n# Ignore these warnings, or even ignore these entries entirely. Apps\n# which need to position the cursor or do other fancy stuff inside the\n# status line won't work with these entries. They're primarily useful\n# for programs like Pine which provide simple notifications in the\n# status line. Please note that non-ASCII characters don't work right\n# in the status line, since Terminal.app incorrectly interprets their\n# Unicode codepoints as MacRoman codepoints (in earlier Mac OS X\n# versions) or only accepts status lines consisting entirely of\n# characters from the first 256 Unicode positions (including C1 but\n# not C0 or DEL.)\n#\n# The Mythology* of AppKit Terminal.app:\n#\n# In the days of NeXTSTEP 0.x and 1.x there were two incompatible\n# bundled terminal emulators, Shell and Terminal. Scott Hess wrote a\n# shareware replacement for Terminal called \"Stuart\" which NeXT bought\n# and used as the basis for the Terminal.app in NeXTSTEP 2+,\n# OPENSTEP/Mach, Apple Rhapsody, Mac OS X Server 1.0, and Mac OS X. I\n# don't know the TERM_PROGRAM and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION settings or\n# capabilities for the early versions, but I believe that the\n# TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION may have been reset at some point.\n#\n# The early versions were tailored to the NeXT character set. Sometime\n# after the Apple acquisition the encoding was switched to MacRoman\n# (initially with serious altcharset bugs due to incomplete conversion\n# of the old NeXT code,) and then later to UTF-8. Also sometime during\n# or just prior to the early days of Mac OS X, the Terminal grew ANSI\n# 8-color support (initially buggy when combined with attributes, but\n# that was later fixed.) More recently, around Mac OS X version 10.3\n# or so (Terminal.app v100+) xterm-like 16-color support was added. In\n# some versions (for instance 133-1 which shipped with Mac OS X\n# version 10.4) this suffered from the <bce> bug, but that seems to\n# have been fixed in Mac OS X version 10.5 (Terminal.app v240.2+).\n#\n# In the early days of Mac OS X the terminal was fairly buggy and\n# would routinely crash under load. Many of these bugs seem to have\n# been fixed around Mac OS X version 10.3 (Terminal.app v100+) but\n# some may still remain. This change seems to correspond to\n# Terminal.app reporting \"xterm-color\" as $TERM rather than \"vt100\" as\n# it did previously.\n#\n# * This may correspond with what actually happened, but I don't\n#   know. It is based on guesswork, hearsay, private correspondence,\n#   my faulty memory, and the following online sources and references:\n#\n# [1] \"Three Scotts and a Duane\" by Simson L. Garfinkel\n# http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Articles/NeXTWORLD/93.8/93.8.Dec.Community1.html\n#\n# [2] NeXTSTEP entry from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n# https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nextstep\n#\n# * Renamed the AppKit Terminal.app entry from \"Apple_Terminal\" to\n#   \"nsterm\" to comply with the name length and case conventions and\n#   limitations of various software packages [notably Solaris terminfo\n#   and UNIX.] A single Apple_Terminal alias is retained for\n#   backwards-compatibility.\n#\n# * Added function key support (F1-F4). These only work in Terminal.app\n#   version 51, hopefully the capabilities won't cause problems for people\n#   using version 41.\n#\n# * Added \"full color\" (-c) entries which support the 16-color mode in\n#   version 51.\n#\n# * By default, version 51 uses UTF-8 encoding with broken altcharset\n#   support, so \"ASCII\" (-7) entries without altcharset support were\n#   added.\n\n# nsterm - AppKit Terminal.app\n#\n# Apple's Mac OS X includes a Terminal.app derived from the old NeXT\n# Terminal.app. It is a partial VT100 emulation with some xterm-like\n# extensions. This terminfo was written to describe versions 41\n# (shipped with Mac OS X version 10.0) and 51 (shipped with Mac OS X\n# version 10.1) of Terminal.app.\n#\n# Terminal.app runs under the Mac OS X Quartz windowing system (and\n# other AppKit-supported windowing systems.)  On the Mac OS X machine I\n# use, the executable for Terminal.app is:\n# /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal\n#\n# If you're looking for a description of the full-screen system\n# console which runs under Apple's Darwin operating system on PowerPC\n# platforms, see the \"xnuppc\" entry instead.\n#\n# There were no function keys in version 41. In version 51, there are\n# four working function keys (F1, F2, F3 and F4.) The function keys\n# are included in all of these entries.\n#\n# It does not support mouse pointer position reporting. Under some\n# circumstances the cursor can be positioned using option-click; this\n# works by comparing the cursor position and the selected position,\n# and simulating enough cursor-key presses to move the cursor to the\n# selected position. This technique fails in all but the simplest\n# applications.\n#\n# It provides partial ANSI color support (background colors interacted\n# badly with bold in version 41, though, as reflected in :ncv:.) The\n# monochrome (-m) entries are useful if you've disabled color support\n# or use a monochrome monitor. The full color (-c) entries are useful\n# in version 51, which doesn't exhibit the background color bug. They\n# also enable an xterm-compatible 16-color mode.\n#\n# The configurable titlebar is set using xterm-compatible sequences;\n# it is used as a status bar in the statusline (-s) entries. Its width\n# depends on font sizes and window sizes, but 50 characters seems to\n# be the default for an 80x24 window.\n#\n# The MacRoman character encoding is used for some of the alternate\n# characters in the \"MacRoman\" entries; the \"ASCII\" (-7) entries\n# disable alternate character set support entirely, and the \"VT100\"\n# (-acs) entries rely instead on Terminal.app's own buggy VT100\n# graphics emulation, which seems to think the character encoding is\n# the old NeXT charset instead of MacRoman. The \"ASCII\" (-7) entries\n# are useful in Terminal.app version 51, which supports UTF-8 and\n# other ASCII-compatible character encodings but does not correctly\n# implement VT100 graphics; once VT100 graphics are correctly\n# implemented in Terminal.app, the \"VT100\" (-acs) entries should be\n# usable in any ASCII-compatible character encoding [except perhaps\n# in UTF-8, where some experts argue for disallowing alternate\n# characters entirely.]\n#\n# Terminal.app reports \"vt100\" as the terminal type, but exports\n# several environment variables which may aid detection in a shell\n# profile (i.e. .profile or .login):\n#\n# TERM=vt100\n# TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal\n# TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=41      # in Terminal.app version 41\n# TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=51      # in Terminal.app version 51\n#\n# For example, the following Bourne shell script would detect the\n# correct terminal type:\n#\n# if [ :\"$TERM\" = :\"vt100\" -a :\"$TERM_PROGRAM\" = :\"Apple_Terminal\" ]\n# then\n#     export TERM\n#     if [ :\"$TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION\" = :41 ]\n#     then\n#         TERM=\"nsterm-old\"\n#     else\n#         TERM=\"nsterm-c-7\"\n#     fi\n# fi\n#\n# In a C shell derivative, this would be accomplished by:\n#\n# if ( $?TERM && $?TERM_PROGRAM && $?TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION) then\n#     if ( :\"$TERM\" == :\"vt100\" && :\"$TERM_PROGRAM\" == :\"Apple_Terminal\" ) then\n#          if ( :\"$TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION\" == :41 ) then\n#              setenv TERM \"nsterm-old\"\n#          else\n#              setenv TERM \"nsterm-c-7\"\n#          endif\n#     endif\n# endif\n\n# The '+'

It is an ANSI-style terminal, and is not really VT-100\n# compatible.\n#\n# Under Mac OS X, this is the system console driver used while in\n# single-user mode [reachable by holding down Command-S during the\n# boot process] and when logged in using console mode [reachable by\n# typing \">console\" at the graphical login prompt.]\n#\n# If you're looking for a description of the Terminal.app terminal\n# emulator which runs under the Mac OS X Quartz windowing system (and\n# other AppKit-supported windowing systems,) see the \"nsterm\"\n# entry instead.\n#\n# NOTE: Under Mac OS X version 10.1, the default login window does not\n# prompt for user name, instead requiring an icon to be selected from\n# a list of known users. Since the special \">console\" login is not in\n# this list, you must make one of two changes in the Login Window\n# panel of the Login section of System Prefs to make the special\n# \">console\" login accessible. The first option is to enable 'Show\n# \"Other User\" in list for network users', which will add a special\n# \"Other...\" icon to the graphical login panel. Selecting \"Other...\"\n# will present the regular graphical login prompt. The second option\n# is to change the 'Display Login Window as:' setting to 'Name and\n# password entry fields', which replaces the login panel with a\n# graphical login prompt.\n#\n# There are no function keys, at least not in Darwin 1.3.\n#\n# It has no mouse support.\n#\n# It has full ANSI color support, and color combines correctly with\n# all three supported attributes: bold, inverse-video and underline.\n# However, bold colored text is almost unreadable (bolding is\n# accomplished using shifting and or-ing, and looks smeared) so bold\n# has been excluded from the list of color-compatible attributes\n# [using (ncv)]. The monochrome entry (-m) is useful if you use a\n# monochrome monitor.\n#\n# There is one serious bug with this terminal emulation's color\n# support: repositioning the cursor onto a cell with non-matching\n# colors obliterates that cell's contents, replacing it with a blank\n# and displaying a colored cursor in the \"current\" colors. There is\n# no complete workaround at present [other than using the monochrome\n# (-m) entries,] but removing the (msgr) capability seemed to help.\n#\n# The \"standout\" chosen was simple reverse-video, although a colorful\n# standout might be more aesthetically pleasing. Similarly, the bold\n# chosen is the terminal's own smeared bold, although a simple\n# color-change might be more readable. The color-bold (-b) entries\n# uses magenta colored text for bolding instead. The fancy color (-f\n# and -f2) entries use color for bold, standout and underlined text\n# (underlined text is still underlined, though.)\n#\n# Apparently the terminal emulator does support a VT-100-style\n# alternate character set, but all the alternate character set\n# positions have been left blank in the font. For this reason, no\n# alternate character set capabilities have been included in this\n# description. The console driver appears to be ASCII-only, so (enacs)\n# has been excluded [although the VT-100 sequence does work.]\n#\n# The default Mac OS X and Darwin installation reports \"vt100\" as the\n# terminal type, and exports no helpful environment variables. To fix\n# this, change the \"console\" entry in /etc/ttys from \"vt100\" to\n# \"xnuppc-WxH\", where W and H are the character dimensions of your\n# console (see below.)\n#\n# The font used by the terminal emulator is apparently one originally\n# drawn by Ka-Ping Yee, and uses 8x16-pixel characters.

Teranishi dated Mar 10, 1998.  It is a free software terminal emulator\n# (communication program) which supports:\n#\n#\t- Serial port connections.\n#\t- TCP/IP (telnet) connections.\n#\t- VT100 emulation, and selected VT200/300 emulation.\n#\t- TEK4010 emulation.\n#\t- File transfer protocols (Kermit, XMODEM, ZMODEM, B-PLUS and\n#\t  Quick-VAN).\n#\t- Scripts using the \"Tera Term Language\".\n#\t- Japanese and Russian character sets.\n#\n# The program does not come with terminfo or termcap entries.  However, the\n# emulation (testing with vttest and ncurses) is reasonably close to VT100 (no\n# VT52 or doublesize character support; blinking is done with color).

The \"XM\" capability is recognized by ncurses to allow\n# enabling/disabling other mouse protocols.  The \"xm\" capability describes the\n# mouse response; currently there is no interpreter which would use this\n# information to make the mouse support completely data-driven.\n\n# Here is the \"original\" xterm mouse protocol.\n#\n# First seen in X10.3, February 1986, this likely dates from 1985 based on the\n# copyright dates in the sources.  A comment in charproc.c notes \"MIT bogus\n# sequence\", referring to the fact that it does not correspond to a \"real\"\n# terminal.

However, they are important because\n# they take up space in the first byte of the response.  The other bits of this\n# byte are used to encode the button number for both presses and releases.\n# In the X11 protocol, any button-release is encoded with \"3\" (the lowest 2\n# bits in the byte).  Later work on XFree86 xterm used the remaining 3 bits to\n# provide additional features, e.g., wheel mouse.\n#\n# X11R1's xterm also supported an \"emacs\" mouse protocol, with final character\n# \"t\" or \"T\", which was activated by double-clicking.  The \"t\" response was\n# used when the starting/ending positions were the same.\n#\n# X11R3 (February 1988) added the highlight/tracking mode.\n#\n# X11R4 (December 1989) added the control sequences document, listing the\n# control sequences for the X10/X11 protocols without descriptions.

For the same reason, the home/end keys differ.  A VT100 had none of\n# that.  The otherwise identical keytabs have definitions to model the VT52\n# cursor-keys and the VT100 cursor-keys with application versus normal modes.\n#\n# An \"x11r5\" keytab (displayed in the menu as \"X11 R5\") was added in January\n# 2001, and shortly after retitled to \"XFree 3.x.x\".  Both it and \"vt100\" were\n# dropped from the install in June 2008.\n#\n# The default keytab added in January 2000 was originally titled \"X11 R6\",\n# and likewise retitled to \"XFree 4\".\n#\n# A \"solaris\" keytab was added in Febrary 2005, copying the \"vt100\" keytab\n# and changing backspace to ^H, removing that keytab's attempt to model the\n# VT100 keypad and VT52 (KDE #20459).\n#\n# The developers made changes to the default and linux keytabs.  Comparing\n# the original and 2018 versions using diffstat:\n#\tdefault: 119 added, 147 deleted, 28 unchanged\n#\tlinux:   47 added, 28 deleted, 104 unchanged\n#\n# Most of the change for the default keytab was to make konsole act more like\n# xterm.  That was a feature named AnyMod which came in May 2005 for KDE #92749\n# (see also Redhat #122815).  Later, in June 2007 the compiled-in keytab was\n# made an external file (like \"linux\" and \"solaris\"), and some further\n# refinement made.  But there are still flaws in the scheme.\n#\n# Essentially AnyMod maps the xterm \"PC-style\" modifier codes such as 2 for\n# Shift into a placeholder in the table entries.  That works well if all of the\n# modified keys are modified in the same way.  But xterm does not do that.  The\n# first 4 function keys are used in xterm to support the VT100 PF1-PF4 keypad\n# keys.  For example, F2 sends \\EOQ in both terminals because of this feature.\n# But a shifted F2 (F14=F2+12) differs like this, in infocmp's listing:\n#\tkf14: '\\E[1;2Q', '\\EO2Q'.\n#\n# In effect, a quarter of konsole's function-keys are different from xterm.\n#\n# It is not a simple blunder:\n# a) xterm patch #121 (November 1999), providing the first version of the\n#    PC-style modifiers would send \\EO2Q\n# b) xterm patch #216 (July 2006) amended this and other details, provided\n#    better documentation for the modifiers and made the behavior configurable,\n#    e.g., using the modifyFunctionKeys resource.  The reason why it sends\n#    \\E[1;2Q is that \\E[O2Q is not a legal ECMA-48 control sequence.

Each\n#      virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in\n#      addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI\n#      X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g.  insert/delete line and support for\n#      multiple character sets).\n#\n# However, there is a design error in its support for video highlights.  The\n# program uses a table (rendlist) which equates the SGR codes to terminal\n# capabilities.  That, and color-decoding are hardcoded in screen; its behavior\n# is modified only by the presence or absence of the corresponding capabilities.\n# Not by their values.\n#\n# If screen sets the TERMCAP variable, it uses hardcoded strings which\n# correspond to the rendlist table.\n#\n# The table gives this information:\n#\n#\tSGR\tcapability\n#\t---\t---------\n#\t1\tbold\n#\t2\tdim\n#\t3\tstandout\n#\t4\tunderline\n#\t5\tblink\n#\t-\t(unused 6)\n#\t7\treverse\n#\t-\t(unused 8-21)\n#\t22\treset bold, standout and dim\n#\t23\treset standout\n#\t24\treset underline\n#\t25\treset blink\n#\t-\t(unused 26)\n#\t27\treset reverse\n#\n# ECMA-48 differs from this: 3 and 23 set and reset italics, respectively.\n# ECMA-48 does not define \"standout\" - that is a termcap/terminfo abstraction.\n# Without some redesign of screen, it is not possible to extend the set of\n# capabilities.  Substitution would be possible, e.g., sending italics in\n# place of underline.\n#\n# Because screen uses hard-coded parsing, it does not check if two capabilities\n# use the same value.  For example, changing standout to be the same as any of\n# the other capabilities will confuse screen.  Curses applications which use\n# sgr are not impacted (because that usually resets all capabilities before\n# setting any), but termcap applications do not use sgr -TD\n#\n# The \"screen\" entry should use ecma+index rather than just indn, but tmux\n# defaults to using \"screen\".  For background, screen supported ecma+index\n# since 1994 (i.e., screen 3.0.5), stating that it was an obscure code used by\n# the (Siemens Nixdorf) 97801 terminal.

True to Microsoft form, not only\n# are the installation instructions a pile of mind-numbing bureaucratese,\n# but the termcap entry is actually broken and unusable as given; the :do:\n# capability is misspelled \"d\".\n#\n# To use this, you need to a bunch of environment variables:\n#\n# SET _POSIX_TERM=on\n# SET TERM=ansi\n# SET TERMCAP=location of termcap file in POSIX file format\n# which is case-sensitive.\n# e.g. SET TERMCAP=//D/RESKIT35/posix/termcap\n# SET TMP=//C/TEMP\n#\n# Important note: setting the TMP environment variable in POSIX style renders\n# it incompatible with a lot of other applications, including Visual C++. So\n# you should have a separate command window just for vi.

Sittler\n#\n# Someone has put a scanned copy of the manual online at:\n#     http://vt100.net/televideo/912b-om/\n#     (https://vt100.net/manx/details/6,5484)\n#\n# These terminals were produced ca. 1979, and had a 12\" monochrome\n# screen, supported 75-9600 baud (no handshaking), monochrome, 7-bit\n# ASCII, and were generally similar to adm3a but with attributes\n# (including some with magic cookies), fancy half-duplex mode, and\n# different bugs.\n#\n# Some operations require truly incredible amounts of padding. The\n# insert_line (<il1>) and delete_line (<dl1>) operations in particular\n# are so slow as to be nearly unusable.\n#\n# There may or may not have been a separate, earlier series of 912/920\n# terminals (without the \"B\" and \"C\" suffix); I have never seen one,\n# and the manual only describes the \"B\" and \"C\" series. The 912 and 920\n# are quite distinct from the 914 and 924, which were much nicer non-\n# magic-cookie terminals similar to the 950.\n#\n# This is a new description for the following TeleVideo terminals,\n# distinguished chiefly by their keyboards:\n#\n#   TVI-912B - very odd layout, no function keys (84 keys)\n#   TVI-920B - typewriter layout, no function keys (103 keys)\n#   TVI-912C - very odd layout, function keys F1-F11 (82 keys)\n#   TVI-920C - typewriter layout, function keys F1-F11 (101 keys)\n#\n# To choose a setting for the TERM variable, start with the model:\n#\n#    Model  || base name\n# ----------||-----------\n#  TVI-912B || tvi912b\n#  TVI-912C || tvi912c\n#  TVI-920B || tvi920b\n#  TVI-920C || tvi920c\n#\n# Then add a suffix from the following table describing installed options\n# and how you'd like to use the terminal:\n#\n#   Use Video | Second | Visual |  Magic  |  Page || feature\n#  Attributes |  Page  |  Bell  | Cookies | Print || suffix\n# ------------|--------|--------|---------|-------||---------\n#      No     |   No   |  N/A   |   N/A   |   No  || -unk\n#      No     |   No   |  N/A   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -p\n#      No     |  Yes   |   No   |   N/A   |   No  || -2p-unk\n#      No     |  Yes   |   No   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -2p-p\n#      No     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   N/A   |   No  || -vb-unk\n#      No     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -vb-p\n#     Yes     |   No   |  N/A   |    No   |  N/A  ||\n#     Yes     |   No   |  N/A   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -mc\n#     Yes     |  Yes   |   No   |    No   |  N/A  || -2p\n#     Yes     |  Yes   |   No   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -2p-mc\n#     Yes     |  Yes   |  Yes   |    No   |  N/A  || -vb\n#     Yes     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -vb-mc\n#\n# So e.g. a model 920 C with second page memory option, visual bell\n# and no magic cookies would be tvi920c-vb; a model 912 B without the\n# second page memory option and using magic cookies would be\n# tvi912b-mc\n#\n# PADDING\n#\n# At 9600 baud, the terminal is prone to overflow its input buffer\n# during complex operations (insert/delete\n# character/line/screen/page), and it does not signal this over the\n# RS232 cable. The typical symptom of an overrun is that the terminal\n# starts beeping, and output becomes garbled.\n#\n# The padding delays in this terminfo were derived using tack(1)\n# running on a Linux box connected to a TVI-920C with a later-model\n# (A49C1-style) ROM running at 9600 baud, so your mileage may\n# vary. The numbers below seem to give the terminal enough time so\n# that it doesn't overflow its input buffer and start losing\n# characters.\n#\n# KEYS\n#\n# If you want to use the FUNCT key on a tvi912[bc], use the\n# corresponding tvi920[bc] terminfo with FUNCT + ... equivalents from\n# the following table (these also work on the 920 series):\n#\n# Unshifted Function Keys:\n#\n#  Key | capname|| Equivalent\n# -----|--------||------------\n#   F1 |  <kf1> || FUNCT + @\n#   F2 |  <kf2> || FUNCT + A\n#   F3 |  <kf3> || FUNCT + B\n#   F4 |  <kf4> || FUNCT + C\n#   F5 |  <kf5> || FUNCT + D\n#   F6 |  <kf6> || FUNCT + E\n#   F7 |  <kf7> || FUNCT + F\n#   F8 |  <kf8> || FUNCT + G\n#   F9 |  <kf9> || FUNCT + H\n#  F10 | <kf10> || FUNCT + I\n#  F11 | <kf11> || FUNCT + J\n#\n# Shifted Function Keys:\n#\n#  SHIFT + Key | capname|| Equivalent\n# -------------|--------||------------\n#   SHIFT + F1 | <kf12> || FUNCT + `\n#   SHIFT + F2 | <kf13> || FUNCT + a\n#   SHIFT + F3 | <kf14> || FUNCT + b\n#   SHIFT + F4 | <kf15> || FUNCT + c\n#   SHIFT + F5 | <kf16> || FUNCT + d\n#   SHIFT + F6 | <kf17> || FUNCT + e\n#   SHIFT + F7 | <kf18> || FUNCT + f\n#   SHIFT + F8 | <kf19> || FUNCT + g\n#   SHIFT + F9 | <kf20> || FUNCT + h\n#  SHIFT + F10 | <kf21> || FUNCT + i\n#  SHIFT + F11 | <kf22> || FUNCT + j\n#\n# PORTS AND SWITCH SETTINGS\n#\n# Here are the switch settings for the TVI-912B/TVI-920B and\n# TVI-912C/TVI-920C:\n#\n# S1 (Line), and S3 (Printer) baud rates -- put one, and only one, switch down:\n# 2: 9600\t3: 4800\t\t4: 2400\t\t5: 1200\n# 6:  600\t7:  300\t\t8:  150\t\t9:   75\n# 10: 110\n#\n# S2 UART/Terminal options:\n#\t\tUp\t\t\tDown\n# 1:\t\tNot used\t\tNot allowed\n# 2:\tAlternate character set\t  Standard character set\n# 3:\t    Full duplex\t\t    Half duplex\n# 4:\t    50 Hz refresh\t    60 Hz refresh\n# 5:\t      No parity\t\t     Send parity\n# 6:\t     2 stop bits\t     1 stop bit\n# 7:\t     8 data bits\t     7 data bits\n# 8:\t\tNot used\t\tNot allowed on Rev E or lower\n# 9:\t     Even parity\t     Odd parity\n# 10:\t    Steady cursor\t    Blinking cursor\n#\t(On Rev E or lower, use W25 instead of switch 10.)\n#\n# S5 UART/Terminal options:\n#\t\tOpen\t\t\tClosed\n# 1:\tP3-6 Not connected\tDSR received on P3-6\n# 2:\tP3-8 Not connected\tDCD received on P3-8\n#\n# 3 Open, 4 Open:\t\tP3-20 Not connected\n# 3 Open, 4 Closed:\tDTR on when terminal is on\n# 3 Closed, 4 Open:\tDTR is connected to RTS\n# 3 Closed, 4 Closed:\tNot allowed\n#\n# 5 Closed:\tHDX printer (hardware control) Rev.

This format is described in\n# <u8> and <u6>, but it's not clear how one should write an\n# appropriate scanf string, since we need to subtract %' ' from the\n# character after reading it. The <u9> capability is used by tack(1)\n# to synchronize during padding tests, and seems to work for that\n# purpose.\n#\n# This description also includes the obsolete termcap capabilities\n# has_hardware_tabs (<OTpt>) and backspaces_with_bs (<OTbs>).\n#\n# FEATURES NOT YET DESCRIBED IN THIS TERMINFO\n#\n# The FUNCT modifier actually works with every normal key by sending\n# ^AX\\r, where X is the sequence normally sent by that key. This is a\n# sort of meta key not currently describable in terminfo.\n#\n# There are quite a few other keys (especially on the 920 models,) but\n# they are for the most part only useful in block mode.\n#\n# These terminals have lots of forms manipulation features, mainly\n# useful in block mode, including \"clear X to nulls\" (vs. \"clear X to\n# spaces\"; nulls are sentinels for \"send X\" operations); \"send X\"\n# operations for uploading all or part of the screen; and block-mode\n# editing keys (they don't send escape sequences, but manipulate video\n# memory directly). Block mode is used for local editing, and protect\n# mode (in conjunction with the \"write protect\" attribute,\n# a.k.a. half-intensity outside of protect mode) is used to control\n# which parts of the screen are edited/sent/printed (by <mc0>).\n#\n# There are at least two major families of ROM, \"early\" and\n# A49B1/A49C1; the major difference seems to be that the latter ROMs\n# support a few extra escape sequences for manipulating the off-screen\n# memory page, and for sending whole pages back to the host (mainly\n# useful in block mode.) The descriptions in this file don't use any\n# of those sequences: set cursor position including page (\\E-PYX,\n# where P is \\s for page 0 and ! for page 1 [actually only the LSB of\n# P is taken into account, so e.g. 0 and 1 work too,] and Y and X are\n# as in <cup>); read cursor position (\\E/), which is analogous to <u9>\n# and returns PYX\\r, where P is \\s for page 0 or ! for page 1, and YX\n# are as in <cup>, and some \"send page\" features mainly useful for\n# forms manipulation.\n#\n# The keyboard enable (\\E\") and disable (\\E#) sequences are unused,\n# except that a terminal reset (<is2>) enables the keyboard.\n#\n# Auto-flip mode (\\Ev) is likely faster than the scrolling mode (\\Ew)\n# enabled in <is2>, but auto-flip is very jarring so we don't use it.\n#\n# BUGS\n#\n# At least up to the A49B1 and A49C1 ROMs, there are no \\Eb and \\Ed\n# sequences (I infer that in some TeleVideo terminal they may invert\n# and uninvert the display) so the <flash> sequence given here is a\n# cheesy page-flip instead.\n#\n# The back_tab (<cbt>) sequence (\\EI) doesn't work according to\n# tack(1), so it is not included in the descriptions below.\n#\n# It's not clear whether auto_left_margin (<bw>) flag should be set\n# for these terminals; tack says yes, so it is set here, but this\n# differs from other descriptions I've seen.\n#\n# Extension print mode (<mc5>) echoes all characters to the printer\n# port [in addition to displaying them] except for the page print mode\n# sequence (<mc4>); this is a slight violation of the terminfo\n# definition for <mc5> but I don't expect it to cause problems.  We\n# reset to page print mode in <rs1> since it may have been enabled\n# accidentally.\n#\n# The descriptions with plus signs (+) are building blocks.\n\ntvi912b-unk|tvi912c-unk|TeleVideo TVI-912B or TVI-912C (no attributes),\n\tOTbs, OTpt, am, bw,\n\tcols#80, it#8, lines#24,\n\tbel=^G, clear=\\032$<50>, cr=\\r, cub1=^H, cud1=\\n, cuf1=^L,\n\tcup=\\E=%p1%' '%+%c%p2%' '%+%c, cuu1=^K, dch1=\\EW$<30>,\n\tdl1=\\ER$<1*>$<100>, ed=\\Ey$<2*>$<10>, el=\\ET$<15>,\n\thome=^^, ht=^I, hts=\\E1, ich1=\\EQ$<30>,\n\tif=/usr/share/tabset/stdcrt, il1=\\EE$<1*>$<100>,\n\tind=\\n$<10>, is2=\\Ew\\EA\\E'\\E\"\\E(, kcub1=^H, kcud1=\\n,\n\tkcuf1=^L, kcuu1=^K, kdch1=^?, kent=\\r, khome=^^, mc4=\\EA,\n\tmc5=\\E@, rs1=\\Ek\\010\\Em\\010\\Eq\\032, tbc=\\E3, u6=%c%c\\r,\n\tu7=\\E?, u8=%c%c\\r, u9=\\E?,\n\n# This isn't included in the basic capabilities because it is\n# typically unusable in combination with the full range of video\n# attributes, since the magic cookie attributes turn into ASCII\n# control characters, and the half-intensity (\"protected\") attribute\n# converts all affected characters to spaces.\n\ntvi912b+printer|TeleVideo TVI-912B/TVI-920B and TVI-912C/TVI-920C page print support,\n\tmc0=\\EP,\n\n# This uses half-intensity mode (<dim>) for standout (<smso>), and\n# exposes no other attributes (half-intensity is the only attribute\n# that does not generate a magic cookie.)\n\ntvi912b+dim|TeleVideo TVI-912B/TVI-920B and TVI-912C/TVI-920C half-intensity attribute support,\n\tmsgr,\n\tdim=\\E), rmso=\\E(, sgr=\\E%?%p1%p5%|%t)%e(%;, sgr0=\\E(,\n\tsmso=\\E),\n\n# Full magic-cookie attribute support, with half-intensity reverse\n# video for standout.

In the\n# late 1980's CIT Terminals went out of business.\n# There is no need to use the initialization string is=... (by invoking\n# tset or setterm etc.) provided that the terminal has been manually set\n# up (and the setup saved with ^S) to be compatible with this termcap.  To be\n# compatible it should be in ANSI mode (not VT52).   A set-up that\n# works is to set all the manually settable stuff to factory defaults\n# by pressing ^D in set-up mode.  Then increase the brightness with the\n# up-arrow key since the factory default will likely be dim on an old\n# terminal.  Then change any options you want (provided that they are\n# compatible with the termcap).  For my terminal I set: Screen\n# Background: light; Keyclicks: silent; Auto wraparound: on; CRT saver:\n# on.  I also set up mine for parity (but you may not need it).

These guys shared the Terminal Brain Damage laurels with Hazeltine.\n# Their terminal group is ancient history now (1995) though the parent\n# company is still in business.\n#\n\n# Beehive documentation is undated and marked Preliminary and has no figures\n# so we must have early Superbee2 (Model 600, according to phone conversation\n# with mfr.). It has proved reliable except for some missing padding\n# (notably after \\EK and <nl> at bottom of screen).\n#\n# The key idea is that AEP mode is poison for <cup> & that US's in\n# the local memory should be avoided like the plague. That means\n# that the 2048 character local buffer is used as 25 lines of 80\n# characters, period. No scrolling local memory, folks. It also\n# appears that we cannot use naked INS LINE feature since it uses\n# US. The sbi fakes <il1> with an 80-space insert that may be too\n# slow at low speeds; also spaces get converted to \\040 which is\n# too long for some programs (not vi).  DEL LINE is ok but slow.\n#\n# The <nl> string is designed for last line of screen ONLY; cup to\n# 25th line corrects the motion inherent in scrolling to Page 1.\n#\n# There is one understood bug. It is that the screen appears to\n# pop to a new (blank) page after a <nel>, or leave a half-line\n# ellipsis to a quad that is the extra 48 memory locations. The\n# data received is dumped into memory but not displayed.  Not to\n# worry if <cup> is being used; the lines not displayed will be,\n# whenever the cursor is moved up there. Since <cup> is addressed\n# relative to MEMORY of window, nothing is lost; but beware of\n# relative cursor motion (<cuu1>,<cud1>,<cuf1>,<cub1>). Recommended,\n# therefore, is setenv MORE -c .\n#\n# WARNING: Not all features tested.\n#\n# Timings are assembled from 3 sources. Some timings may reflect\n# SB2/Model 300 that were used if more conservative.\n# Tested on a Model 600 at 1200 and 9600 bd.\n#\n# The BACKSPACEkb option is cute. The NEWLINE key, so cleverly\n# placed on the keyboard and useless because of AEP, is made\n# into a backspace key.

Vi has to delete to end of line and then\n# redraw the rest of the line.\nesprit|Hazeltine Esprit I,\n\tOTbs, am, bw,\n\tcols#80, lines#24,\n\tbel=^G, cbt=\\E^T, clear=\\E^\\, cr=\\r, cub1=^H, cud1=\\E^K,\n\tcuf1=^P, cup=\\E\\021%p2%c%p1%c, cuu1=\\E^L, dl1=\\E^S,\n\ted=\\E^W, el=\\E^O, home=\\E^R, il1=\\E^Z, ind=\\n, is2=\\E?, kbs=^H,\n\tkcub1=^H, kcud1=\\E^K, kcuf1=^P, kcuu1=\\E^L, kf0=^B0\\n,\n\tkf1=^B1\\n, kf2=^B2\\n, kf3=^B3\\n, kf4=^B4\\n, kf5=^B5\\n,\n\tkf6=^B6\\n, kf7=^B7\\n, kf8=^B8\\n, kf9=^B9\\n, khome=\\E^R,\n\tlf0=0, lf1=1, lf2=2, lf3=3, lf4=4, lf5=5, lf6=6, lf7=7, lf8=8, lf9=9,\n\trmkx=\\E>, rmso=\\E^Y, smkx=\\E<, smso=\\E^_,\nesprit-am|Hazeltine esprit auto-margin,\n\tam, use=esprit,\n# Hazeltine Modular-1 from Cliff Shackelton <ittvax!ittral!shackelt> via BRL\n# Vi it seems always wants to send a control J for \"do\" and it turned out\n# that the terminal would work somewhat if the auto LF/CR was turned off.\n# (hmod1: removed :dn=~^K: -- esr)\nhmod1|Hazeltine Modular 1,\n\tOTbs, am, hz,\n\tcols#80, lines#24,\n\tbel=^G, cbt=~^T, clear=~^\\, cr=\\r, cub1=^H, cud1=~^K, cuf1=^P,\n\tcup=~\\021%p2%c%p1%c, cuu1=~^L, dl1=~^S, home=~^R, il1=~^Z,\n\tind=\\n, kcub1=^H, kcud1=~^K, kcuf1=^P, kcuu1=~^L, khome=~^R,\n\trc=~^Q, rmso=~^Y, sc=~^E, sgr0=~^Y, smso=~^_,\n#\n# Hazeltine Executive 80 Model 30 (1554?)\n#\tfrom  Will Martin <control@ALMSA-1.ARPA> via BRL\n# Like VT100, except for different \"am\" behavior.\nhazel|exec80|h80|he80|Hazeltine Executive 80,\n\tOTbs, OTpt, am,\n\tcols#80, it#8, lines#24, vt#3,\n\tOTnl=\\n, bel=^G, blink=\\E[5m$<2/>, bold=\\E[1m$<2/>,\n\tclear=\\E[;H\\E[2J$<50/>, cr=\\r, csr=\\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dr,\n\tcub1=^H, cud1=\\n, cuf1=\\E[C$<2/>,\n\tcup=\\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH$<5/>, cuu1=\\E[A$<2/>,\n\ted=\\E[J$<50/>, el=\\E[K$<3/>, home=\\E[H, ht=^I,\n\tis2=\\E[1;24r\\E[24;1H, kbs=^H, kcub1=\\EOD, kcud1=\\EOB,\n\tkcuf1=\\EOC, kcuu1=\\EOA, kf1=\\EOP, kf2=\\EOQ, kf3=\\EOR,\n\tkf4=\\EOS, rc=\\E8, rev=\\E[7m$<2/>,\n\trf=/usr/share/tabset/vt100, ri=\\EM$<5/>,\n\trmkx=\\E[?1l\\E>, rmso=\\E[m$<2/>, rmul=\\E[m$<2/>,\n\trs1=\\E>\\E[?3l\\E[?4l\\E[?5l\\E[?7h\\E[?8h, sc=\\E7,\n\tsgr0=\\E[m$<2/>, smkx=\\E[?1h\\E=, smso=\\E[7m$<2/>,\n\tsmul=\\E[4m$<2/>,\n\n#### IBM\n#\n\nibm327x|line mode IBM 3270 style,\n\tgn,\n\tclear=\\r\\n, el=\\r, home=\\r,\n\nibm3101|i3101|IBM 3101-10,\n\tOTbs, am, xon,\n\tcols#80, lines#24,\n\tbel=^G, clear=\\EK, cr=\\r, cub1=^H, cud1=\\n, cuf1=\\EC,\n\tcup=\\EY%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c, cuu1=\\EA, ed=\\EJ,\n\tel=\\EI, home=\\EH, hts=\\E0, ind=\\n, kcub1=\\ED, kcud1=\\EB,\n\tkcuf1=\\EC, kcuu1=\\EA, nel=\\r\\n, tbc=\\EH,\nibm3151|IBM 3151 display,\n\tis2=\\E S, rmacs=\\E>B, rmcup=\\E>B, rs2=\\E S, s0ds=\\E>B,\n\tsgr=\\E4%{64}%?%p1%t%{65}%|%;%?%p2%t%{66}%|%;%?%p3%t%{65}%|%;\n\t    %?%p4%t%{68}%|%;%?%p5%t%{64}%|%;%?%p6%t%{72}%|%;%?%p7%t\n\t    %{80}%|%;%c%?%p9%t\\E>A%e\\E>B%;,\n\tsgr0=\\E4@\\E>B, smacs=\\E>A, smcup=\\E>B, use=ibm3162,\n# From: Mark Easter <marke@fsi-ssd.csg.ssd.fsi.com> 29 Oct 1992\n# removed kend, knp, kpp -TD\n#\n# From: Stephen Powell <zlinuxman@wowway.com> 23 Apr 2015\n# Added ich1 (kich1 without ich1 doesn't make sense).\n# Added il1 (kil1 without il1 doesn't make sense).\n# Added xon (terminal uses XON/XOFF flow control).\n#\nibm3161|ibm3163|wy60-316X|wyse60-316X|IBM 3161/3163 display,\n\tOTbs, am, mir, msgr, xon,\n\tcols#80, it#8, lines#24,\n\tacsc=j\\352k\\353l\\354m\\355n\\356q\\361t\\364u\\365v\\366w\\367x\n\t     \\370,\n\tbel=^G, blink=\\E4D, bold=\\E4H, clear=\\EH\\EJ, cr=\\r, cub1=\\ED,\n\tcud1=\\EB, cuf1=\\EC, cup=\\EY%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c,\n\tcuu1=\\EA, dch1=\\EQ, dl1=\\EO, ed=\\EJ, el=\\EI, home=\\EH,\n\tich1=\\EP \\010, il1=\\EN, ind=\\n, invis=\\E4P, kbs=^H, kcbt=\\E2,\n\tkclr=\\EL\\r, kctab=\\E1, kcub1=\\ED, kcud1=\\EB, kcuf1=\\EC,\n\tkcuu1=\\EA, kdch1=\\EQ, kdl1=\\EO, ked=\\EJ, kel=\\EI, kf1=\\Ea\\r,\n\tkf10=\\Ej\\r, kf11=\\Ek\\r, kf12=\\El\\r, kf13=\\E!a\\r,\n\tkf14=\\E!b\\r, kf15=\\E!c\\r, kf16=\\E!d\\r, kf17=\\E!e\\r,\n\tkf18=\\E!f\\r, kf19=\\E!g\\r, kf2=\\Eb\\r, kf20=\\E!h\\r,\n\tkf21=\\E!i\\r, kf22=\\E!j\\r, kf23=\\E!k\\r, kf24=\\E!l\\r,\n\tkf3=\\Ec\\r, kf4=\\Ed\\r, kf5=\\Ee\\r, kf6=\\Ef\\r, kf7=\\Eg\\r,\n\tkf8=\\Eh\\r, kf9=\\Ei\\r, khome=\\EH, khts=\\E0, kich1=\\EP \\010,\n\tkil1=\\EN, ktbc=\\E 1, mc4=^P^T, mc5=^P^R, rev=\\E4A,\n\trmcup=\\E>A, rmso=\\E4@, rmul=\\E4@,\n\tsgr=\\E4%{64}%?%p1%t%{65}%|%;%?%p2%t%{66}%|%;%?%p3%t%{65}%|%;\n\t    %?%p4%t%{68}%|%;%?%p5%t%{64}%|%;%?%p6%t%{72}%|%;%?%p7%t\n\t    %{80}%|%;%c%?%p9%t\\E>A%e\\E<@%;,\n\tsgr0=\\E4@\\E<@, smcup=\\E>A, smso=\\E4A, smul=\\E4B,\n\nibm3161-C|IBM 3161-C NLS terminal using cartridge,\n\trmcup=\\E>B, s0ds=\\E>B, s1ds=\\E>A, smcup=\\E>B, use=ibm3161,\n#\n# From: Stephen Powell <zlinuxman@wowway.com> 23 Apr 2015\n# Deleted il1.

Follow-on from\n#       Prism-2, but with many enhancements. P5 has eight display pages.\n#\n# Prism-6:\n#       A special terminal for use with library systems, primarily in Germany.\n#       Limited numbers.

If you have some users using act4s with\n# programs that use curses and graphics mode this could be a problem.\nmime314|mm314|mime 314,\n\tam,\n\tcols#80, lines#24,\n\tclear=^L, cub1=^H, cuf1=^X, cup=\\024%p1%c%p2%c, cuu1=^Z,\n\tdch1=^D, dl1=^W, ed=^_, el=^^, home=^], ht=^I, il1=^A, kcub1=^H,\n\tkcud1=^K, kcuf1=^X, kcuu1=^Z, rmir=^V, smir=^S,\n# Microterm mime 340 from University of Wisconsin\nmm340|mime340|mime 340,\n\tcols#80, lines#24,\n\tclear=\\032$<12/>, cr=\\r, cub1=^H, cud1=\\n, cuf1=^L,\n\tcup=\\E=%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c, cuu1=^K,\n\tdch1=\\E#$<2.1*/>, dl1=\\EV$<49.6/>, ed=\\037$<2*/>,\n\tel=\\EL$<2.1/>, ht=^I, il1=\\EU$<46/>, ind=\\n, is2=\\E\\,,\n\tkbs=^H, kcub1=^H, kcud1=\\n, kcuu1=^K, nel=\\r\\n,\n# This came from University of Wisconsin marked \"astro termcap for jooss\".\n# (mt4520-rv: removed obsolete \":kn#4:\" and incorrect \":ri=\\E[C:\";\n# also added <rmam>/<smam> based  on the init string -- esr)\nmt4520-rv|micro-term 4520 reverse video,\n\tam, hs, msgr, xenl, xon,\n\tcols#80, it#8, lines#24, wsl#80,\n\tbel=^G, clear=\\E[H\\E[J, cnorm=\\E[0V\\E8, cr=\\r,\n\tcsr=\\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dr, cub=\\E[%p1%dD, cub1=\\E[D,\n\tcud=\\E[%p1%dB, cud1=\\E[B, cuf=\\E[%p1%dC, cuf1=\\E[C,\n\tcup=\\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH, cuu=\\E[%p1%dA, cuu1=\\E[A,\n\tcvvis=\\E7\\E[0U, dch=\\E[%p1%dP, dch1=\\E[P, dl=\\E[%p1%dM,\n\tdl1=\\E[M, ed=\\E[J, el=\\E[K, flash=\\E[?5l$<200/>\\E[?5h,\n\tfsl=\\E[?5l\\E[?5h, home=\\E[H, ht=^I, hts=\\EH, ich=\\E[%p1%d@,\n\tich1=\\E[@, il=\\E[%p1%dL, il1=\\E[L, ind=\\ED,\n\tis2=\\E(B\\E[2l\\E>\\E[20l\\E[?3l\\E[?5h\\E[?7h\\E[1;24r\\E[24;1H\\E[H\n\t    \\E[J,\n\tkbs=^H, kcub1=\\E[D, kcud1=\\E[B, kcuf1=\\E[C, kcuu1=\\E[A,\n\tkf1=\\EOP, kf2=\\EOQ, kf3=\\EOR, kf4=\\EOS, khome=\\E[H,\n\tll=\\E[24;1H, nel=\\EE, rc=\\E8, rf=/usr/share/tabset/vt100,\n\tri=\\EM, rmam=\\E[?7l, rmso=\\E[0m, rmul=\\E[24m,\n\trs1=\\E(B\\E[2l\\E>\\E[20l\\E[?3l\\E[?5h\\E[?7h\\E[H\\E[J,\n\tsc=\\E7, sgr0=\\E[m, smam=\\E[?7h, smso=\\E[7m, smul=\\E[4m,\n\ttbc=\\E[g, tsl=\\E[25;1H,\n\n# Fri Aug  5 08:11:57 1983\n# This entry works for the ergo 4000 with the following setups:\n# ansi,wraparound,newline disabled, xon/xoff disabled in both\n# setup a & c.\n#\n# WARNING!!!

But lo, upon the horizon loomed a mighty management-type person\n#  (known now only by the initials VP) who said, the mighty Jerq must stay\n#  alone, and could not go forth into the world. So Locanthi and Pike put the\n#  Jerq to sleep, cloned its parts, and the Blit was brought forth unto the\n#  world. And the Jerq lived the rest of its days in research, but never\n#  strayed from those paths.\n#\n#  In all seriousness, the Blit was originally known as the Jerq, but when\n#  it started to be shown outside of the halls of the Bell Labs Research\n#  organization, the management powers that be decided that the name could\n#  not remain. So it was renamed to be Blit. This was in late 1981.\n#\n# (The AT&T 5620 was the commercialized Blit.  Its successors were the 630,\n# 730, and 730+.)\n#\n\nblit|jerq|blit running teletype rom,\n\tam, eo, ul, xon,\n\tcols#87, it#8, lines#72,\n\tbel=^G, clear=^L, cr=\\r, cub1=\\ED, cud1=\\n, cuf1=\\EC,\n\tcup=\\EY%p2%{32}%+%c%p1%{32}%+%c, cuu1=\\EA,\n\tdch=\\Ee%p1%{32}%+%c, dch1=\\Ee!, dl=\\EE%p1%{32}%+%c,\n\tdl1=\\EE!, el=\\EK, ht=^I, ich=\\Ef%p1%{32}%+%c, ich1=\\Ef!,\n\til=\\EF%p1%{32}%+%c, il1=\\EF!, ind=\\n, kbs=^H, kcub1=\\ED,\n\tkcud1=\\EB, kcuf1=\\EC, kcuu1=\\EA, kf1=\\Ex, kf2=\\Ey, kf3=\\Ez,\n\n# (cbblit: here's a BSD termcap that says <cud1=\\EG> -- esr)\ncbblit|fixterm|blit running columbus code,\n\tcols#88,\n\ted=\\EJ, flash=\\E^G, ich1@, mc4=^T, mc5=^R, mc5p=\\EP%p1%03d,\n\trmir=\\ER, rmso=\\EV!, rmul=\\EV\", smir=\\EQ, smso=\\EU!,\n\tsmul=\\EU\", use=blit,\n\noblit|ojerq|first version of blit rom,\n\tam, da, db, eo, mir, ul, xon,\n\tcols#88, it#8, lines#72,\n\tbel=^G, clear=^L, cr=\\r, cub1=\\ED, cud1=\\n, cuf1=\\EC,\n\tcup=\\EY%p2%{32}%+%c%p1%{32}%+%c, cuu1=\\EA, dch1=\\EO,\n\tdl=\\Ee%p1%{32}%+%c, dl1=\\EE, ed=\\EJ, el=\\EK, flash=\\E^G,\n\tht=^I, il=\\Ef%p1%{32}%+%c, il1=\\EF, ind=\\n, kbs=^H, rmir=\\ER,\n\tsmir=\\EQ,\n\n#### Bolt, Beranek & Newman (bbn)\n#\n# The BitGraph was a product of the now-defunct BBN Computer Corporation.\n# The parent company, best known as the architects of the Internet, is\n# still around.\n#\n# Jeff DelPapa <dp@world.std.com> writes:\n# The bitgraph was a large white box that contained a monochrome bitmap\n# display, and a 68000 to run it.  You could download code and run it on\n# the cpu, it had 128kb (I think) of memory.  I used one in the late\n# 70's, sure beat a VT100.  It had one strange feature tho -- it used\n# the cpu to bitblt pixels to scroll, it took longer than the refresh\n# rate, and looked like a rubber sheet stretching, then snapping\n# upwards.  It had everything the early mac had, except a floppy drive a\n# small screen (it had a 17\" crisp beauty) and a real OS. They (Bolt\n# Beranek and Neuman) sold at most a few hundred of them to the real\n# world.  DOD may have bought more...\n#\n\n# Entries for the BitGraph terminals.  The problem\n# with scrolling in vi can only be fixed by getting BBN to put\n# smarter scroll logic in the terminal or changing vi or padding\n# scrolls with about 500 ms delay.\n#\n# I always thought the problem was related to the terminal\n# counting newlines in its input buffer before scrolling and\n# then moving the screen that much. Then vi comes along and\n# paints lines in on the bottom line of the screen, so you get\n# this big white gap.\n\nbitgraph|bg2.0nv|bg3.10nv|BBN BitGraph 2.0 or later (normal video),\n\tflash=\\E[?5h$<200/>\\E[?5l, is2=\\E>\\E[?5l\\E[?7h,\n\tuse=bg2.0,\nbg2.0rv|bg3.10rv|BBn BitGraph 2.0 (reverse video),\n\tflash=\\E[?5l$<200/>\\E[?5h, is2=\\E>\\E[?5h\\E[?7h,\n\tuse=bg2.0,\nbg2.0|bg3.10|BBN BitGraph 2.0 or later (no init),\n\tOTbs, xenl,\n\tcols#85, lines#64,\n\tbel=^G, clear=\\E[H\\E[J$<150>, cr=\\r,\n\tcsr=\\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dr, cub1=^H, cud1=\\E[B, cuf1=\\E[C,\n\tcup=%i\\E[%p1%d;%p2%dH, cuu1=\\E[A, dl1=\\E[M$<2*>,\n\ted=\\E[J$<150>, el=\\E[K$<2>, ht=^I, il1=\\E[L$<2*>,\n\tind=\\n$<280>, kcub1=\\E[D, kcud1=\\E[B, kcuf1=\\E[C,\n\tkcuu1=\\E[A, kf1=\\EOP, kf2=\\EOQ, kf3=\\EOR, kf4=\\EOS, lf1=PF1,\n\tlf2=PF2, lf3=PF3, lf4=PF4, rc=\\E8, rmkx=\\E>, rmso=\\E[m, sc=\\E7,\n\tsgr0=\\E[m, smkx=\\E=, smso=\\E[7m,\n\nbg1.25rv|BBN BitGraph 1.25 (reverse video),\n\tflash=\\E[?5l$<200/>\\E[?5h, is2=\\E>\\E[?5h\\E[?7h,\n\tuse=bg1.25,\nbg1.25nv|BBN BitGraph 1.25 (normal video),\n\tflash=\\E[?5h$<200/>\\E[?5l, is2=\\E>\\E[?5l\\E[?7h,\n\tuse=bg1.25,\n# (bg1.25: I added <rmam>/<smam> based on the init string -- esr)\nbg1.25|BBN BitGraph 1.25,\n\tcols#85, lines#64,\n\tbel=^G, clear=\\E[H\\E[J$<150>, cr=\\r, cub1=^H, cud1=\\E[B,\n\tcuf1=\\E[C, cup=%i\\E[%p1%d;%p2%dH, cuu1=\\E[A,\n\tdl1=\\E[M$<2*>, ed=\\E[J$<150>, el=\\E[K$<2>, ht=^I,\n\til1=\\E[L$<2*>, ind=\\n$<280>, kcub1=\\ED, kcud1=\\EB,\n\tkcuf1=\\EC, kcuu1=\\EA, kf1=\\EP, kf2=\\EQ, kf3=\\ER, kf4=\\ES,\n\tlf1=PF1, lf2=PF2, lf3=PF3, lf4=PF4, ll=\\E[64;1H, rmam=\\E[?7l,\n\trmkx=\\E>, rmso=\\E[m, sgr0=\\E[m, smam=\\E[?7h, smkx=\\E=,\n\tsmso=\\E[7m,\n\n#### Bull (bq, dku, vip)\n#\n# (Adapted for terminfo; AIX extension capabilities translated -- esr)\n\n#============================================#\n# BULL QUESTAR 210 `SDP' terminals emulation #\n#============================================#\n#\n# Description written by R.K.Saunders (Bull Transac)\n#\n# Modifications written by F.

It especially loses if a program attempts\n# to put the Z29 into insert mode and insert text at 9600 baud. It\n# even loses worse if the program attempts to insert tabs at 9600\n# baud. Adding padding to text that is inserted loses because in\n# order to make the Z29 not die, one must add so much padding that\n# whenever the program tries to use insert mode, the effective\n# rate is about 110 baud.\n#\n# What program would want to put the terminal into insert mode\n# and shove stuff at it at 9600 baud you ask?\n#\n# Emacs. Emacs seems to want to do the mathematically optimal\n# thing in doing a redisplay rather than the practical thing.\n# When it is about to output a line on top of a line that is\n# already on the screen, instead of just killing to the end of\n# the line and outputting the new line, it compares the old line\n# and the new line and if there are any similarities, it\n# constructs the new line by deleting the text on the old line\n# on the terminal that is already there and then inserting new\n# text into the line to transform it into the new line that is\n# to be displayed. The Z29 does not react kindly to this.\n#\n# But don't cry for too long.... There is a solution. You can make\n# a termcap entry for the Z29 that says the Z29 has no insert mode.\n# Then Emacs cannot use it. \"Oh, no, but now inserting into a\n# line will be really slow\", you say. Well there is a sort of a\n# solution to that too. There is an insert character option on\n# the Z29 that will insert one character. Unfortunately, it\n# involves putting the terminal into ANSI mode, inserting the\n# character, and changing it back to H19 mode. All this takes 12\n# characters. Pretty expensive to insert one character, but it\n# works. Either Emacs doesn't try to use its inserting hack when\n# it's only given an insert character ability or the Z29 doesn't\n# require padding with this (the former is probably more likely,\n# but I haven't checked it out).\n# (z29: added empty <acsc> to suppress a tic warning, merged in\n# status line capabilities from BRL entry --esr)\nz29|zenith29|z29b|Zenith z29b,\n\tOTbs, OTpt, am, eslok, hs, mir, msgr,\n\tOTkn#10, cols#80, lines#24,\n\tOTbc=\\ED, acsc=, bel=^G, cbt=\\E-, clear=\\EE$<14>, cnorm=\\Ey4,\n\tcr=\\r, cub1=^H, cud1=\\EB, cuf1=\\EC,\n\tcup=\\EY%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c, cuu1=\\E$<1>A,\n\tcvvis=\\Ex4, dch1=\\EN$<0.1*>, dl1=\\EM$<1/>, dsl=\\Ey1,\n\ted=\\EJ$<14>, el=\\EK$<1>, fsl=\\Ek\\Ey5, home=\\EH, ht=^I,\n\tich1=\\E<\\E[1@\\E[?2h$<1>, il1=\\EL$<1/>, ind=\\n$<2>,\n\tis2=\\E<\\E[?2h\\Ev, kbs=^H, kcub1=\\ED, kcud1=\\EB, kcuf1=\\EC,\n\tkcuu1=\\EA, kf0=\\E~, kf1=\\ES, kf2=\\ET, kf3=\\EU, kf4=\\EV,\n\tkf5=\\EW, kf6=\\EP, kf7=\\EQ, kf8=\\ER, kf9=\\E0I, khome=\\EH,\n\tlf0=home, ri=\\EI$<2/>, rmacs=\\EF, rmir=\\EO, rmso=\\Eq,\n\trmul=\\Es0, smacs=\\EG, smir=\\E@, smso=\\Ep, smul=\\Es8,\n\ttsl=\\Ej\\Ex5\\Ex1\\EY8%+ \\Eo,\n# z29 in ANSI mode.

The KTM-2/40\n# was a 40x24 terminal that could connect to a standard TV through a\n# video modulator.  The KTM-2/80 was the 80-column version (the 2/40\n# could be upgraded to the 2/80 by adding 2 2114 SRAMs and a new ROM).\n# I have a KTM-2/80 still in working order.  The KTM-2s had fully\n# socketed parts, used 2 6507s, a 6532 as keyboard scanner, a program\n# ROM and 2 ROMs as character generators. They were incredibly simple,\n# and I've never had any problems with mine (witness the fact that mine\n# was made in 1981 and is still working great... I've blown the video\n# output transistor a couple of times, but it's a 2N2222 :-)\n#\n# The KTM-3 (which is what is listed in the terminfo file) was their\n# attempt at putting a KTM-2 in a box (and some models came with a\n# CRT). It wasn't much different from the KTM-2 hardware-wise, but the\n# control and escape sequences are very different. The KTM-3 was always\n# real broken, at least according to the folks I've talked to about it.\n#\n# The padding in the entry is probably off--these terminals were very\n# slow (it takes like 100ms for the KTM-2 to clear the screen...) And\n# anyone with any sanity replaced the ROMs with something that provided\n# a reasonable subset of VT100 functionality, since the usual ROMs were\n# obviously very primitive... oh, you could get an upgraded ROM from\n# Synertek for some incredible amount of money, but what hacker with an\n# EPROM burner would do that? :)\n#\n# Sorry I don't have any contact info; I believe they were located in\n# Sunnyvale, and I'm fairly sure they are still manufacturing ICs\n# (they've gone to ASICs and FPGAs), but I doubt they're in the computer\n# business these days.\n#\n\n# Tested, seems to work fine with vi.\nsynertek|ktm|synertek380|Synertek KTM 3/80 tubeless terminal,\n\tam,\n\tcols#80, lines#24,\n\tclear=^Z, cub1=^H, cuf1=^L,\n\tcup=\\E=%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c, cuu1=^K, ed=\\EJ, el=\\EK,\n\n#### Tab Office Products\n#\n#\tTAB Products Co. - Palo Alto, California\n#\tElectronic Office Products,\n#\t1451 California Avenue 94304\n#\n# I think they're out of business.\n#\n\n# The tab 132 uses xon/xoff, so no padding needed.\n# <smkx>/<rmkx> have nothing to do with arrow keys.\n# <is2> sets 80 col mode, normal video, autowrap on (for <am>).\n# Seems to be no way to get rid of status line.\n# The manual for this puppy was dated June 1981.

W. Sittler <bsittler@nmt.edu>\n#\n# I have a UNIX PC which I use as a terminal attached to my Linux PC.\n# Unfortunately, the UNIX PC terminfo entry that comes with ncurses\n# is broken. All the special key sequences are broken, making it unusable\n# with Emacs. The problem stems from the following:\n#\n# The UNIX PC has a plethora of keys (103 of them, and there's no numeric\n# keypad!), loadable fonts, and strange highlighting modes (\"dithered\"\n# half-intensity, \"smeared\" bold, and real strike-out, for example.) It also\n# uses resizable terminal windows, but the bundled terminal program always\n# uses an 80x24 window (and doesn't support seem to support a 132-column\n# mode.)\n#\n# HISTORY: The UNIX PC was one of the first machines with a GUI, and used a\n# library which was a superset of SVr3.5 curses (called tam, for \"terminal\n# access method\".) tam includes support for real, overlapping windows,\n# onscreen function key labels, and bitmap graphics. But since the primary\n# user interface on the UNIX PC was a GUI program (ua, for \"user\n# assistant\",) and remote administration was considered important for the\n# machine, tam also supported VT100-compatible terminals attached to the\n# serial port or used across the StarLan network. To simulate the extra keys\n# not present on a VT100, users could press ESC and a two-letter sequence,\n# such as u d (Undo) or U D (Shift-Undo.) These two-letter sequences,\n# however, were not the same as those sent by the actual Undo key. The\n# actual Undo key sends ESC 0 s unshifted, and ESC 0 S shifted, for example.\n# (If you're interested in adding some of the tam calls to ncurses, btw, I\n# have the full documentation and several programs which use tam. It also\n# used an extended terminfo format to describe key sequences, special\n# highlighting modes, etc.)\n#\n# KEYS: This means that ncurses would quite painful on the UNIX PC, since\n# there are two sequences for every key-modifier combination (local keyboard\n# sequence and remote \"VT100\" sequence.) But I doubt many people are trying\n# to use ncurses on the UNIX PC, since ncurses doesn't properly handle the\n# GUI. Unfortunately, the terminfo entry (and the termcap, too, I presume)\n# seem to have been built from the manual describing the VT100 sequences.\n# This means it doesn't work for a real live UNIX PC.\n#\n# FONTS: The UNIX PC also has a strange interpretation of \"alternate\n# character set\". Rather than the VT100 graphics you might expect, it allows\n# up to 8 custom fonts to be loaded at any given time. This means that\n# programs expecting VT100 graphics will usually be disappointed. For this\n# reason I have disabled the smacs/rmacs sequences, but they could easily be\n# re-enabled. Here are the relevant control sequences (from the ESCAPE(7)\n# manpage), should you wish to do so:\n#\n# SGR10 - Select font 0 - ESC [ 10 m or SO\n# SGR11 - Select font 1 - ESC [ 11 m or SI\n# SGR12 - Select font 2 - ESC [ 12 m\n# ... (etc.)\n# SGR17 - Select font 7 - ESC [ 17 m\n#\n# Graphics for line drawing are not reliably found at *any* character\n# location because the UNIX PC has dynamically reloadable fonts. I use font\n# 0 for regular text and font 1 for italics, but this is by no means\n# universal. So ASCII line drawing is in order if smacs/rmacs are enabled.\n#\n# MISC: The cursor visible/cursor invisible sequences were swapped in the\n# distributed terminfo.\n#\n# To ameliorate these problems (and fix a few highlighting bugs) I rewrote\n# the UNIX PC terminfo entry. The modified version works great with Lynx,\n# Emacs, and XEmacs running on my Linux PC and displaying on the UNIX PC\n# attached by serial cable. In Emacs, even the Undo key works, and many\n# applications can now use the F1-F8 keys.\n#\n# esr's notes:\n#\tTerminfo entry for the AT&T Unix PC 7300\n#\tfrom escape(7) in Unix PC 7300 Manual.\n#\tSomewhat similar to a vt100-am (but different enough\n#\tto redo this from scratch.)\n#\n#\t/***************************************************************\n#\t*\n#\t*           FONT LOADING PROGRAM FOR THE UNIX PC\n#\t*\n#\t*     This routine loads a font defined in the file ALTFONT\n#\t*     into font memory slot #1.

All the keys are crammed together, much like some laptop\n# PCs today, but perhaps less well organized...all these units have a\n# bewildering array of plugs on the back, including a built-in modem.\n# The 305 was a color version of the 304; the 306 and 307 were mono and\n# color terminals built for IBM bisync protocols.\n# From: Paul Leondis <unllab@amber.berkeley.edu>\nifmr|Informer D304,\n\tOTbs, am,\n\tcols#80, lines#24,\n\tclear=\\EZ, cub1=^H, cud1=\\n, cuf1=\\EC,\n\tcup=\\EY%p2%{32}%+%c%p1%{32}%+%c, cuu1=\\EA, dch1=\\E\\\\,\n\ted=\\E/, el=\\EQ, home=\\EH, ich1=\\E[, ri=\\En, rmso=\\EK, sgr0=\\EK,\n\tsmso=\\EJ,\n# Entry largely based on wy60 and has the features of wy60ak.\nopus3n1+|Esprit Opus3n1+ in wy60 mode with ANSI arrow keys,\n\tam, bw, hs, km, mir, msgr, ul, xon,\n\tcols#80, lh#1, lines#24, lw#8, nlab#8, wsl#80,\n\tacsc=0wa_h[jukslrmqnxqzttuyv]wpxv, bel=^G, blink=\\EG2,\n\tcbt=\\EI, civis=\\E`0, clear=\\E*$<100>, cnorm=\\E`1, cr=\\r,\n\tcub1=^H, cud1=\\n, cuf1=^L, cup=\\Ea%i%p1%dR%p2%dC, cuu1=^K,\n\tdch1=\\EW$<11>, dim=\\EGp, dl1=\\ER$<5>, dsl=\\Ez(\\r,\n\ted=\\EY$<100>, el=\\ET, fsl=\\r, home=\\036$<2>, ht=\\011$<5>,\n\thts=\\E1, if=/usr/share/tabset/std, il1=\\EE$<4>, ind=\\n,\n\tip=$<3>,\n\tis2=\\E`:\\Ee(\\EO\\Ee6\\Ec41\\E~4\\Ec21\\Ed/\\Ezz&\\E[A\\177\\Ezz'\\E[B\n\t    \\177\\Ezz(\\E[D\\177\\Ezz)\\E[C\\177\\Ezz<\\E[Q\\177\\Ezz`\\E[F\n\t    \\177\\EA1*\\EZH12,\n\tkHOM=\\E{, kbs=^H, kcbt=\\EI, kcub1=\\E[D, kcud1=\\E[B,\n\tkcuf1=\\E[C, kcuu1=\\E[A, kdch1=\\EW, kdl1=\\ER, ked=\\EY,\n\tkel=\\ET, kend=\\E[F, kent=\\E7, kf1=^A@\\r, kf10=^AI\\r,\n\tkf11=^AJ\\r, kf12=^AK\\r, kf13=^AL\\r, kf14=^AM\\r, kf15=^AN\\r,\n\tkf16=^AO\\r, kf2=^AA\\r, kf3=^AB\\r, kf4=^AC\\r, kf5=^AD\\r,\n\tkf6=^AE\\r, kf7=^AF\\r, kf8=^AG\\r, kf9=^AH\\r, khome=^^,\n\tkich1=\\EQ, kil1=\\EE, knp=\\EK, kpp=\\EJ, kprt=\\EP, krpl=\\Er,\n\tmc0=\\EP, mc4=^T, mc5=^R, nel=\\r\\n$<3>,\n\tpfloc=\\EZ2%p1%{63}%+%c%p2%s\\177,\n\tpfx=\\EZ1%p1%{63}%+%c%p2%s\\177,\n\tpln=\\Ez%p1%{47}%+%c%p2%s\\r, prot=\\E), ri=\\Ej$<7>,\n\trmacs=\\EH^C, rmam=\\Ed., rmcup=, rmir=\\Er, rmln=\\EA11,\n\trmxon=\\Ec20, rs1=\\E~!\\E~4$<150>, rs2=\\EeF$<150>,\n\trs3=\\EwG\\Ee($<150>,\n\tsgr=%?%p8%t\\E)%e\\E(%;%?%p9%t\\EH\\002%e\\EH\\003%;\\EG%{48}%?%p2\n\t    %t%{8}%|%;%?%p1%p3%|%t%{4}%|%;%?%p4%t%{2}%|%;%?%p1%p5%|\n\t    %t%{64}%|%;%?%p7%t%{1}%|%;%c,\n\tsgr0=\\E(\\EH\\003\\EG0\\EcD, smacs=\\EH^B, smam=\\Ed/,\n\tsmcup=\\Ezz&\\E[A\\177\\Ezz'\\E[B\\177\\Ezz(\\E[D\\177\\Ezz)\\E[C\\177\n\t      \\Ezz<\\E[Q\\177,\n\tsmir=\\Eq, smln=\\EA10, smxon=\\Ec21, tbc=\\E0, tsl=\\Ez(,\n\tuc=\\EG8\\EG0, use=adm+sgr,\nteletec|Teletec Datascreen,\n\tOTbs, am,\n\tcols#80, lines#24,\n\tbel=^G, clear=^L, cr=\\r, cub1=^H, cud1=\\n, cuf1=^_, cuu1=^K,\n\thome=^^, ind=\\n,\n# From: Mark Dornfeld <romwa@ucbvax.berkeley.edu>\n# This description is for the LANPAR Technologies VISION 3220\n# terminal from 1984/85.

These scopes were made\n# by an outfit called LANPAR Technologies, and were meant to me DEC VT 220\n# compatible.  The 3220 was a plain text terminal like the VT-220, the 3221\n# was a like the VT-240 (monochrome with Regis + Sixel graphics), and the 3222\n# was like the VT-241 (color with Regis + Sixel Graphics).  These terminals\n# (3221) cost about $1500 each, and one was always broken -- had to be sent\n# back to the shop for repairs.\n# The only real advantage these scopes had over the VT-240's were:\n# 1) They were faster in the Regis display, or at least the ones I did\n# 2) They had a handy debugging feature where you could split-screen the\n# scope, the graphics would appear on the top, and the REGIS commands would\n# appear on the bottom.  I don't remember the VT-240s being able to do that.\n# I would swear that LANPAR Technologies was in MA someplace, but since I\n# don't work at the same place anymore, and those terminals and manuals were\n# long since junked, I cannot be any more sure than that.\n#\n# (v3220: removed obsolete \":kn#10:\",\n# I added <rmam>/<smam> based on the init string -- esr)\nv3220|LANPAR Vision II model 3220/3221/3222,\n\tOTbs, am, mir, xenl,\n\tcols#80, it#8, lines#24,\n\tclear=\\E[H\\E[J, cub1=^H, cud1=\\E[B, cuf1=\\E[C,\n\tcup=\\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH, cuu1=\\E[A, dch1=\\E[P, dl1=\\E[M,\n\ted=\\E[J, el=\\E[K, ht=^I, il1=\\E[L,\n\tis2=\\E>\\E[?3l\\E[?7h\\E[?8h\\E[p, kcub1=\\E[D, kcud1=\\E[B,\n\tkcuf1=\\E[C, kcuu1=\\E[A, kf0=\\E[1~, kf1=\\E[2~, kf2=\\E[3~,\n\tkf3=\\E[4~, kf4=\\E[5~, kf5=\\E[6~, kf6=\\E[OP, kf7=\\E[OQ,\n\tkf8=\\E[OR, kf9=\\E[OS, khome=\\E[H, ri=\\EM, rmam=\\E[?7l,\n\trmir=\\E[4l, rmkx=\\E>, rmso=\\E[m, rmul=\\E[m, sgr0=\\E[m,\n\tsmam=\\E[?7h, smir=\\E[4h, smkx=\\E=, smso=\\E[7m, smul=\\E[4m,\n######## ICH/ICH1 VERSUS RMIR/SMIR\n#\n# Some non-curses applications get confused if both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir\n# are present; the symptom is doubled characters in an update using insert.\n# These applications are technically correct; in both 4.3BSD termcap and\n# terminfo, you're not actually supposed to specify both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir\n# unless the terminal needs both.  To my knowledge, no terminal still in this\n# file requires both other than the very obsolete dm2500.\n#\n# For ncurses-based applications this is not a problem, as ncurses uses\n# one or the other as appropriate but never mixes the two.  Therefore we\n# have not corrected entries like `linux' and `xterm' that specify both.\n# If you see doubled characters from these, use the linux-nic and xterm-nic\n# entries that suppress ich/ich1.

Informally\n# format effectors may be destructive; format effectors should not be.\n#\n# For instance, a format effector that moves the \"active position\" (the\n# cursor or equivalent) one space to the left would be useful when you want to\n# create an overstrike, a compound character made of two standard characters\n# overlaid. Control-H, the Backspace character, is actually supposed to be a\n# format effector, so you can do this. But many systems use it in a\n# nonstandard fashion, as an editor function, deleting the character to the\n# left of the cursor and moving the cursor left. When Control-H is assumed to\n# be an editor function, you cannot predict whether its use will create an\n# overstrike unless you also know whether the output device is in an \"insert\n# mode\" or an \"overwrite mode\". When Control-H is used as a format effector,\n# its effect can always be predicted. The familiar characters carriage\n# return, linefeed, formfeed, etc., are defined as format effectors.\n#\n# NOTES ON THE DEC VT100 IMPLEMENTATION\n#\n# Control sequences implemented in the VT100 are as follows:\n#\n#      CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, DA, DSR, ED, EL, HTS, HVP, IND,\n#      LNM, NEL, RI, RIS, RM, SGR, SM, TBC\n#\n# plus several private DEC commands.\n#\n# Erasing parts of the display (EL and ED) in the VT100 is performed thus:\n#\n#      Erase from cursor to end of line           Esc [ 0 K    or Esc [ K\n#      Erase from beginning of line to cursor     Esc [ 1 K\n#      Erase line containing cursor               Esc [ 2 K\n#      Erase from cursor to end of screen         Esc [ 0 J    or Esc [ J\n#      Erase from beginning of screen to cursor   Esc [ 1 J\n#      Erase entire screen                        Esc [ 2 J\n#\n# Some brain-damaged terminal/emulators respond to Esc [ J as if it were\n# Esc [ 2 J, but this is wrong; the default is 0.\n#\n# The VT100 responds to receiving the DA (Device Attributes) control\n#\n#      Esc [ c    (or Esc [ 0 c)\n#\n# by transmitting the sequence\n#\n#      Esc [ ? l ; Ps c\n#\n# where Ps is a character that describes installed options.\n#\n# The VT100's cursor location can be read with the DSR (Device Status\n# Report) control\n#\n#      Esc [ 6 n\n#\n# The VT100 reports by transmitting the CPR sequence\n#\n#      Esc [ Pl ; Pc R\n#\n# where Pl is the line number and Pc is the column number (in decimal).\n#\n# The specification for the DEC VT100 is document EK-VT100-UG-003.\n\n#### ANSI.SYS\n#\n# Here is a description of the color and attribute controls supported in the\n# the ANSI.SYS driver under MS-DOS.  Most console drivers and ANSI\n# terminal emulators for Intel boxes obey these.  They are a proper subset\n# of the ECMA-48 escapes.\n#\n# 0\tall attributes off\n# 1\tforeground bright\n# 4\tunderscore on\n# 5\tblink on/background bright (not reliable with brown)\n# 7\treverse-video\n# 8\tset blank (non-display)\n# 10\tset primary font\n# 11\tset first alternate font (on PCs, display ROM characters 1-31)\n# 12\tset second alternate font (on PCs, display IBM high-half chars)\n#\n#\t\t\tColor attribute sets\n# 3n\tset foreground color       / 0=black, 1=red,     2=green, 3=brown,\n# 4n\tset background color       \\ 4=blue,  5=magenta, 6=cyan,  7=white\n# Bright black becomes gray.  Bright brown becomes yellow,\n# These coincide with the prescriptions of the ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.\n#\n# * If the 5 attribute is on and you set a background color (40-47) it is\n#   supposed to enable bright background.\n#\n# * Many VGA cards (such as the Paradise and compatibles) do the wrong thing\n#   when you try to set a \"bright brown\" (yellow) background with attribute\n#   5 (you get a blinking yellow foreground instead).  A few displays\n#   (including the System V console) support an attribute 6 that undoes this\n#   braindamage (this is required by iBCS2).\n#\n# * Some older versions of ANSI.SYS have a bug that causes them to require\n#   ESC [ Pn k as EL rather than the ANSI ESC [ Pn K.  (This is not ECMA-48\n#   compatible.)\n\n#### Intel Binary Compatibility Standard\n#\n# For comparison, here are the capabilities implied by the Intel Binary\n# Compatibility Standard for UNIX systems (Intel order number 468366-001).\n# These recommendations are optional.  IBCS2 allows the leading escape to\n# be either the 7-bit \\E[ or 8-bit \\0233 introducer, in accordance with\n# the ANSI X.364/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.  Here are the iBCS2 capabilities\n# (as described in figure 9-3 of the standard).

Its signature is the KM capability, used to name\n# some sort of keymap file.  EE, BO, CI, CV, XS, DS, FL and FE are in this\n# set.  Comments in the original, and a little cross-checking with other AT&T\n# documentation, seem to establish that BO=:mr: (start reverse video), DS=:mh:\n# (start dim), XS=:mk: (secure/invisible mode), EE=:me: (end highlights),\n# FL=:LO: (enable soft labels), FE=:LF: (disable soft labels), CI=:vi: (make\n# cursor invisible), and CV=:ve: (make cursor normal).\n#\n#### HP Extensions\n#\n# The HP library (as of mid-1995, their term.h file version 70.1) appears to\n# have the System V capabilities up to SVr1 level.  After that, it supports\n# two nonstandard caps meml and memu corresponding to the old termcap :ml:,\n# :mu: capabilities.  After that, it supports caps plab_norm, label_on,\n# label_off, and key_f11..key_f63 capabilities like SVr4's.  This makes the\n# HP binary format incompatible with SVr4's.\n#\n#### IBM Extensions\n#\n# There is a set of nonstandard terminfos used by IBM's AIX operating system.\n# The AIX terminfo library diverged from SVr1 terminfo, and replaces all\n# capabilities following prtr_non with the following special capabilities:\n# box[12], batt[12], colb[0123456789], colf[0123456789], f[01234567], kbtab,\n# kdo, kcmd, kcpn, kend, khlp, knl, knpn, kppn, kppn, kquit, ksel, kscl, kscr,\n# ktab, kmpf[123456789], apstr, ksf1..ksf10, kf11...kf63, kact, topl, btml,\n# rvert, lvert.   Some of these are identical to XPG4/SVr4 equivalents:\n# kcmd, kend, khlp, and kf11...kf63.  Two others (kbtab and ksel) can be\n# renamed (to kcbt and kslt).  The places in the box[12] capabilities\n# correspond to acsc chars, here is the mapping:\n#\n#\tbox1[0]  = ACS_ULCORNER\n#\tbox1[1]  = ACS_HLINE\n#\tbox1[2]  = ACS_URCORNER\n#\tbox1[3]  = ACS_VLINE\n#\tbox1[4]  = ACS_LRCORNER\n#\tbox1[5]  = ACS_LLCORNER\n#\tbox1[6]  = ACS_TTEE\n#\tbox1[7]  = ACS_RTEE\n#\tbox1[8]  = ACS_BTEE\n#\tbox1[9]  = ACS_LTEE\n#\tbox1[10] = ACS_PLUS\n#\n# The box2 characters are the double-line versions of these forms graphics.\n# The AIX binary terminfo format is incompatible with SVr4's.\n#\n#### Iris console extensions:\n#\n# HS is half-intensity start; HE is half-intensity end\n# CT is color terminal type (for Curses & rogue)\n# CP is color change escape sequence\n# CZ are color names (for Curses & rogue)\n#\n# The ncurses tic utility recognizes HS as an alias for mh <dim>.\n#\n#### TC Extensions:\n#\n# There is a set of extended termcaps associated with something\n# called the \"Terminal Control\" or TC package created by MainStream Systems,\n# Winfield Kansas.  This one also uses GS/GE for as/ae, and also uses\n# CF for civis and CO for cvvis.  Finally, they define a boolean :ct:\n# that flags color terminals.\n#\n######## NCURSES USER-DEFINABLE CAPABILITIES\n#\n# Extensions added after ncurses 5.0 generally use the \"-x\" option of tic and\n# infocmp to manipulate user-definable capabilities.  Those that are intended\n# for use in either terminfo or termcap use 2-character names.  Extended\n# function keys do not use 2-character names, and are available only with\n# terminfo.\n#\n# Beginning in 2010, NetBSD curses has also provided a \"-x\" option for\n# tic/infocmp, and uses this database (with a few changes).  There are a few\n# differences, noted in\n#\thttps://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-netbsd.html\n#\n# ncurses makes explicit checks for a few user-definable capabilities:  AX,\n# RGB, U8, XM, which are documented in the user_caps(5) manual page.\n#\n#### SCREEN Extensions:\n#\n# The screen program uses the termcap interface.  It recognizes a few useful\n# nonstandard capabilities.  Those are used in this file.\n#\n#       AX   (bool)  Does  understand  ANSI  set  default fg/bg color (\\E[39m /\n#                    \\E[49m).\n#       G0   (bool)  Terminal can deal with ISO 2022  font  selection sequences.\n#       E0   (str)   Switch charset 'G0' back to standard charset.\n#       S0   (str)   Switch charset 'G0' to the specified charset.\n#       XT   (bool)  Terminal understands special xterm sequences  (OSC,  mouse\n#                    tracking).\n#\n# AX is relatively straightforward; it is interpreted by ncurses to say that\n# SGR 39/49 reset the terminal's foreground and background colors to their\n# \"default\".\n#\n# XT is harder, since screen's manpage does not give more details.  For that,\n# we must read screen's source-code.  For example, when XT is set, screen\n# assumes\n#\n# a) OSC 1 sets the title string, e.g., for the icon.  Recent versions of\n#    screen may also set the terminal's name, which is (for xterm) distinct\n#    from the icon name.\n# b) OSC 20 sets the background pixmap.  This is an rxvt feature.\n# c) OSC 39 and OSC 49 set the default foreground/background colors.  Again\n#    this is an rxvt feature.\n# d) certain mode settings enable the mouse: 9, 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003.\n#    These are from xterm, although xterm accepts mouse codes that may not be\n#    recognized by screen, e.g., 1005, 1006.\n# e) colors beyond 0..7 are implemented by xterm's aixterm-like 16-color\n#    sequence.  However, because screen uses only termcap, the values returned\n#    by Af/Ab are not usable because they rely on expressions that termcap\n#    does not support.  Therefore, screen uses a hardcoded string to work\n#    around the limitation.  In a few cases, screen also uses tparm, which\n#    is a terminfo function rather than termcap.\n# f) all entries named \"*xterm*\" or \"*rxvt*\" have the bce flag set.\n# g) screen also uses the feature to decide whether to pay attention to other\n#    xterm-related features which are unrelated to the description in the\n#    manual page.\n#\n# Since XT is useful only when the outer terminal matches screen's assumptions,\n# it is appropriate to use it in the derived terminal descriptions such as\n# \"screen.xterm\", but not in the generic \"screen\", \"screen-bce\" entries.\n#\n# The other ISO-2022 features are rarely used, but provided here to make\n# screen's termcap features available.\n#\n#### XTERM Extensions:\n#\n# For a discussion of \"xterm\", \"xterm-256color\" as values for TERM, see\n#\thttps://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#xterm_generic\n#\thttps://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#xterm_256color\n#\n# For xterm control sequences, see\n#\thttps://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html\n#\n# For function-keys with modifiers, see\n#\thttps://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#modified_keys\n#\n# For a discussion of \"bracketed paste\", see\n#\thttps://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm-paste64.html\n#\n# Most of the xterm extensions are for function-keys.  Since xterm patch #94 (in\n# 1999), xterm has supported shift/control/alt/meta modifiers which produce\n# additional function-key strings.  Some other developers copied the feature,\n# though they did not follow xterm's lead in xterm patch #167 (in 2002), to make\n# these key definitions less ambiguous.\n#\n# A few terminals provide similar functionality (sending distinct keys when\n# a modifier is used), including rxvt.\n#\n# These are the extended keys defined in this file:\n#\n# kDC3 kDC4 kDC5 kDC6 kDC7 kDN kDN3 kDN4 kDN5 kDN6 kDN7 kEND3 kEND4 kEND5 kEND6\n# kEND7 kHOM3 kHOM4 kHOM5 kHOM6 kHOM7 kIC3 kIC4 kIC5 kIC6 kIC7 kLFT3 kLFT4\n# kLFT5 kLFT6 kLFT7 kNXT3 kNXT4 kNXT5 kNXT6 kNXT7 kPRV3 kPRV4 kPRV5 kPRV6 kPRV7\n# kRIT3 kRIT4 kRIT5 kRIT6 kRIT7 kUP kUP3 kUP4 kUP5 kUP6 kUP7 ka2 kb1 kb3 kc2\n#\n# Bracketed paste is described with these capabilities in vim:\n#\n# BE enables bracketed paste\n# BD disables bracketed paste\n# PS is sent before the pasted text\n# PE is sent after the pasted text\n#\n# Here are the other xterm-related extensions which are used in this file:\n#\n# Cr is a string capability which resets the cursor color\n# Cs is a string capability which sets the cursor color to a given value.\n#    The single string parameter is the color name/number, according to the\n#    implementation.\n# Ms modifies the selection/clipboard.  Its parameters are\n#\tp1 = the storage unit (clipboard, selection or cut buffer)\n#\tp2 = the base64-encoded clipboard content.\n# Se resets the cursor style to the terminal power-on default.\n# Ss is a string capability with one numeric parameter.  It is used to set the\n#    cursor style as described by the DECSCUSR function to a block or\n#    underline.\n# TS is a string capability which acts like \"tsl\", but uses no parameter and\n#    goes to the first column of the \"status line\".\n# XM is a string capability which overrides ncurses's built-in string which\n#    enables/disables xterm mouse mode.\n# xm shows the format of the mouse responses.  Parameters:\n#\tp1 = y-ordinate\n#\tp2 = x-ordinate\n#\tp3 = button\n#\tp4 = state, e.g., pressed or released\n#\tp5 = y-ordinate starting region\n#\tp6 = x-ordinate starting region\n#\tp7 = y-ordinate ending region\n#\tp8 = x-ordinate ending region\n# Other extensions, used in xm:\n#\t%u = UTF-8\n#\n#### Miscellaneous extensions:\n#\n# csr clears the status line\n# gsbom/grbom are used to enable/disable real bold (not intensity bright) mode.\n#    This was implemented for the Hurd.\n# rmxx/smxx describes the ECMA-48 strikeout/crossed-out attributes, as an\n#    experimental feature of tmux.\n# CO gives the number of indexed (\"ANSI\") colors which overlay an RGB color\n#    space.\n# E3 clears the terminal's scrollback buffer.  This was implemented in the\n#    Linux 3.0 kernel as a security feature.  It matches a feature which was\n#    added in xterm patch #107.\n# NQ denotes a terminal which does not support the standard query/response used\n#    in u6/u7 (cursor position) and u8/u9 (device attributes).\n# U8 is a numeric capability which denotes a terminal emulator which does not\n#    support VT100 SI/SO when processing UTF-8 encoding.  Set this to a nonzero\n#    value to enable it.\n# Smulx modifies the appearance of underlines in VTE, December 2017.\n#\n######## CHANGE HISTORY\n#\n# The last /etc/termcap version maintained by John Kunze was 8.3, dated 8/5/94.\n# Releases 9 and 10 (up until the release of ncurses 4.2 in 1998) were\n# maintained by Eric S. Raymond as part of the ncurses project.\n#\n# This file contains all the capability information present in John Kunze's\n# last version of the termcap master file, except as noted in the change\n# comments at end of file.  Some information about very ancient obsolete\n# capabilities has been moved to comments.  Some all-numeric names of older\n# terminals have been retired.\n#\n# I changed :MT: to :km: (the 4.4BSD name) everywhere.  I commented out some\n# capabilities (EP, dF, dT, dV, kn, ma, ml, mu, xr, xx) that are no longer\n# used by BSD curses.\n#\n# The 9.1.0 version of this file was translated from my lightly-edited copy of\n# 8.3, then mechanically checked against 8.3 using Emacs Lisp code written for\n# the purpose.  Unless the ncurses tic implementation and the Lisp code were\n# making perfectly synchronized mistakes which I then failed to catch by\n# eyeball, the translation was correct and perfectly information-preserving.\n#\n# Major version number bumps correspond to major version changes in ncurses.\n#\n# Here is a log of the changes since then:\n#\n# 9.1.0 (Wed Feb  1 04:50:32 EST 1995):\n#\t* First terminfo master translated from 8.3.\n# 9.2.0 (Wed Feb  1 12:21:45 EST 1995):\n#\t* Replaced Wyse entries with updated entries supplied by vendor.\n#\n# 9.3.0 (Mon Feb  6 19:14:40 EST 1995):\n#\t* Added contact & status info from G.
