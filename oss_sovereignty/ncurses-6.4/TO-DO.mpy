We should\n  develop a good set of regression tests to cover lib_doupdate.c and\n  lib_mvcur.c.\n\n+ Magic cookie support (for nonzero xmc values) does not work, since the logic\n  does not take into account refresh.  Also, the initial optimize does not\n  adjust the current location when a cookie is emitted.\n\n+ Scrolling optimization has holes:  for example, it forces repaints of the\n  screen between calls to refresh().\n\n+ SVr4 uses slightly different rules for determining when softkeys are shown.\n  For example, they are initially displayed (before the ncurses 'e' test\n  activates them), and a touchwin can apparently also force them to be\n  displayed.\n\n+ The code departs from perfect 8-bit cleanness in one respect; you cannot\n  specify a character \\200 as part of a capability string, because the\n  terminfo library interprets \\200 as a request to embed NUL (\\000) at that\n  point.  This is a legacy terminfo property we can't mess with.\n\n+ The window classes defined in the c++ subdirectory need documentation.  Some\n  C++ programmer could earn a lot of good karma by doing this...\n\n+ vid_attr() should support the set_a_attributes (sgr1) string, but does not.\n  There appear to be no terminals that require that functionality.\n\n+ the configure --disable-ext-funcs option does not work for Ada95 tree.\n\n+ the --with-pthread configuration builds for Cygwin, but does not work\n  properly (test/worm.c shows all of the worms in the same location).\n\n+ the --enable-rpath configure option builds for the corresponding platforms;\n  however combining it with --with-ticlib and --with-termlib does not always\n  produce libraries that can be run without setting environment variables.\n  Building those with libtool does not work either.  (This is a problem with\n  the BSD platforms).\n\n+ more work is needed to make the MinGW port support ordinary terminals.\n\nPortability (or lack thereof):\n\n+ Users of older System V UNIXes (but not Solaris, and probably not SVr4) may\n  trip over a known problem with the signal-handling code which causes abrupt\n  termination of ncurses applications following resume from a ^Z suspend (this\n  problem was first seen running lynx).  You will not see this problem if you\n  are using one of the 4.4BSD derivatives like such as, NetBSD, or BSDI, or\n  systems using that convention.  For details, see the analysis in the header\n  comment of ncurses/tty/lib_tstp.c .\n\n+ In theory, vwprintw and vwscanf are supposed to use the older varargs.h\n  interface for handling variadic argument lists (and are deprecated by X/Open\n  for that reason).  Many newer systems do no have varargs.h, instead they have\n  only the newer X/Open-standard stdargs.h equivalent.  So these functions use\n  stdargs instead.  This is unlikely to be a problem unless you're building\n  ncurses on a System V old enough to only have varargs.h.  (Solaris 2.5.1 used\n  the stdarg.h binding as well).\n\n+ If you're using a system old enough not to have a native vsscanf(3) in its\n  library, vwscanw() will not work.  If you want to fix this, add an\n  implementation to ncurses/vsscanf.c.\n\n+ The C++ binding fails to build with a few C++ compilers.\n\n+ terminfo.5 does not format with the SunOS (and most other platform's) tbl\n  utility because it relies on a diversion for each table entry.  Get the\n  groff package.\n\nUntested features:\n\n+ The code for the HP color model using set_color_pair is untested.\n\n+ The code for handling soft labels on a terminal type with built-in support\n  for them (num_labels > 0, label_height, label_width, label_format, label_off,\n  label_on, plab_norm, lab_f*) has not been tested.  The label_format and\n  lab_f* capabilities aren't presently used.\n\nLONGER-TERM TO-DO ITEMS:\n\n1. Extended COSE conformance\n\nThere is an XPG4 standard released in 1996 which describes a superset\nof the SVr4 API.  The library is BASE conformant with this standard.\nWe would like to make ncurses fully conformant at the EXTENDED level\nsupporting internationalization.\n\n2. DOS port\n\nOnly a few of the files in the library depend on the terminfo format.\nIt should be possible to further kernelize the package, then rewrite\na small number of core files to produce a functionally-compatible\nport that would do updates to a memory-mapped screen area.  The first\nresult of this would be a DOS port.\n\n3. X port\n\nIt would be nice if ncurses could recognize when it was running under X and\nmaintain its own window.  With this feature, all ncurses programs would\nautomatically become X programs.  The challenge is to handle resize events\nproperly.\n\n4. Unused capabilities\n\nThe currently unused capabilities fall naturally into several groups:\n\nA. Status-line capabilities:\n\n\tBooleans: has_status_line, status_line_esc_ok.\n\tNumerics: width_status_line.\n\tStrings: dis_status_line, from_status_line, to_status_line.\n\nSystem V Release 1 curses made no use of these at all.  SVr4's use, if\nany, is unknown.  From the AT&T termcap file it looks like curses, in general,\nshouldn't use them; terminal variants with status lines have their line count\ndecremented by 1, suggesting that curses is supposed to leave the status line\nalone.\n\nB. Printer capabilities:\n\n\tBoolean: col_addr_glitch, cr_cancels_micro_mode, has_print_wheel,\n\t\trow_addr_glitch, semi_auto_right_margin, cpi_changes_res,\n\t\tlpi_changes_res.\n\tNumeric: buffer_capacity, dot_horz_spacing, dot_vert_spacing,\n\t\tmax_micro_address, max_micro_jump, micro_col_size,\n\t\tmicro_line_size, number_of_pins, output_res_char,\n\t\toutput_res_line, output_res_horz_inch, print_rate,\n\t\twide_char_size, bit_image_entwining, bit_image_type.\n\tString: down_half_line, form_feed, up_half_line, set_left_margin,\n\t\tset_right_margin, clear_margins, change_char_pitch\n\t\t... set_page_length (all the SVr4 printer caps),\n\nCurses doesn't use these.\n\nC. Printer-control capabilities:\n\n\tBoolean: prtr_silent.\n\tStrings: print_screen, prtr_on, prtr_off, prtr_non.\n\nCurses doesn't use these.\n\nD. Dialer strings:\n\n\tStrings: hangup, dial_phone, quick_dial, tone, pulse, flash_hook,\n\t\tfixed_pause, wait_tone.\n\nCurses doesn't use these.\n\nE. Window and virtual-terminal capabilities:\n\n\tNumerics: maximum_windows, virtual_terminal.\n\tStrings: req_for_input, create_window, goto_window, set_window.\n\nThese seem to be fossils from some AT&T experiments on character-based\nwindow systems that never escaped the lab.  The virtual_terminal cap had\nsomething to do with building terminal emulations into tty line disciplines.\n\nF. Unused VDT capabilities:\n\n\tBooleans: erase_overstrike, has_meta_key, insert_null_glitch,\n\t\tmove_insert, dest_tabs_magic_smso, transparent_underline,\n\t\tneeds_xon_xoff, hard_cursor.\n\tNumerics: lines_of_memory, buttons.\n\tStrings: pkey_key, pkey_local, pkey_xmit, underline_char,\n\t\tenter_xon_mode,\texit_xon_mode, xon_character, xoff_character,\n\t\tdisplay_clock, remove_clock, user[0-5], display_pc_char,\n\t\tenter_scancode_mode, exit_scancode_mode, pc_term_options,\n\t\tscancode_escape, alt_scancode_esc.\n\nThese are the potentially important ones for ncurses.  Notes:\n\n\ti) ncurses doesn't need move_insert; it never uses cup/hpa/vpa while\n\t\tinsert_mode is on.\n\n\tii) We probably don't care about dest_tabs_magic_smso; only\n\t\tTelerays used it and they're all long obsolete.\n\n-- vile:txtmode\n",
