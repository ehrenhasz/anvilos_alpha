They should be owned by root,\n             readable only by root, and not accessible to others.  Since they\n             are readable only by root, ssh-keysign must be set-uid root if\n             host-based authentication is used.\n\n     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key-cert.pub\n     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub\n     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub\n     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub\n             If these files exist, they are assumed to contain public\n             certificate information corresponding with the private keys\n             above.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1), ssh_config(5), sshd(8)\n\nHISTORY\n     ssh-keysign first appeared in OpenBSD 3.2.\n\nAUTHORS\n     Markus Friedl <markus@openbsd.org>\n\nOpenBSD 7.3                     March 31, 2022                     OpenBSD 7.3\n",
