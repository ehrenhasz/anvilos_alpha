configuration file\n.Sh DESCRIPTION\n.Xr ssh 1\nobtains configuration data from the following sources in\nthe following order:\n.Pp\n.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact\n.It\ncommand-line options\n.It\nuser's configuration file\n.Pq Pa ~/.ssh/config\n.It\nsystem-wide configuration file\n.Pq Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config\n.El\n.Pp\nUnless noted otherwise, for each parameter, the first obtained value\nwill be used.\nThe configuration files contain sections separated by\n.Cm Host\nspecifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that\nmatch one of the patterns given in the specification.\nThe matched host name is usually the one given on the command line\n(see the\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\noption for exceptions).\n.Pp\nSince the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more\nhost-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the\nfile, and general defaults at the end.\n.Pp\nThe file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.\nLines starting with\n.Ql #\nand empty lines are interpreted as comments.\nArguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes\n.Pq \\&\"\nin order to represent arguments containing spaces.\nConfiguration options may be separated by whitespace or\noptional whitespace and exactly one\n.Ql = ;\nthe latter format is useful to avoid the need to quote whitespace\nwhen specifying configuration options using the\n.Nm ssh ,\n.Nm scp ,\nand\n.Nm sftp\n.Fl o\noption.\n.Pp\nThe possible\nkeywords and their meanings are as follows (note that\nkeywords are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):\n.Bl -tag -width Ds\n.It Cm Host\nRestricts the following declarations (up to the next\n.Cm Host\nor\n.Cm Match\nkeyword) to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns\ngiven after the keyword.\nIf more than one pattern is provided, they should be separated by whitespace.\nA single\n.Ql *\nas a pattern can be used to provide global\ndefaults for all hosts.\nThe host is usually the\n.Ar hostname\nargument given on the command line\n(see the\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\nkeyword for exceptions).\n.Pp\nA pattern entry may be negated by prefixing it with an exclamation mark\n.Pq Sq !\\& .\nIf a negated entry is matched, then the\n.Cm Host\nentry is ignored, regardless of whether any other patterns on the line\nmatch.\nNegated matches are therefore useful to provide exceptions for wildcard\nmatches.\n.Pp\nSee\n.Sx PATTERNS\nfor more information on patterns.\n.It Cm Match\nRestricts the following declarations (up to the next\n.Cm Host\nor\n.Cm Match\nkeyword) to be used only when the conditions following the\n.Cm Match\nkeyword are satisfied.\nMatch conditions are specified using one or more criteria\nor the single token\n.Cm all\nwhich always matches.\nThe available criteria keywords are:\n.Cm canonical ,\n.Cm final ,\n.Cm exec ,\n.Cm localnetwork ,\n.Cm host ,\n.Cm originalhost ,\n.Cm Tag ,\n.Cm user ,\nand\n.Cm localuser .\nThe\n.Cm all\ncriteria must appear alone or immediately after\n.Cm canonical\nor\n.Cm final .\nOther criteria may be combined arbitrarily.\nAll criteria but\n.Cm all ,\n.Cm canonical ,\nand\n.Cm final\nrequire an argument.\nCriteria may be negated by prepending an exclamation mark\n.Pq Sq !\\& .\n.Pp\nThe\n.Cm canonical\nkeyword matches only when the configuration file is being re-parsed\nafter hostname canonicalization (see the\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\noption).\nThis may be useful to specify conditions that work with canonical host\nnames only.\n.Pp\nThe\n.Cm final\nkeyword requests that the configuration be re-parsed (regardless of whether\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\nis enabled), and matches only during this final pass.\nIf\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\nis enabled, then\n.Cm canonical\nand\n.Cm final\nmatch during the same pass.\n.Pp\nThe\n.Cm exec\nkeyword executes the specified command under the user's shell.\nIf the command returns a zero exit status then the condition is considered true.\nCommands containing whitespace characters must be quoted.\nArguments to\n.Cm exec\naccept the tokens described in the\n.Sx TOKENS\nsection.\n.Pp\nThe\n.Cm localnetwork\nkeyword matches the addresses of active local network interfaces against the\nsupplied list of networks in CIDR format.\nThis may be convenient for varying the effective configuration on devices that\nroam between networks.\nNote that network address is not a trustworthy criteria in many\nsituations (e.g. when the network is automatically configured using DHCP)\nand so caution should be applied if using it to control security-sensitive\nconfiguration.\n.Pp\nThe other keywords' criteria must be single entries or comma-separated\nlists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the\n.Sx PATTERNS\nsection.\nThe criteria for the\n.Cm host\nkeyword are matched against the target hostname, after any substitution\nby the\n.Cm Hostname\nor\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\noptions.\nThe\n.Cm originalhost\nkeyword matches against the hostname as it was specified on the command-line.\nThe\n.Cm tagged\nkeyword matches a tag name specified by a prior\n.Cm Tag\ndirective or on the\n.Xr ssh 1\ncommand-line using the\n.Fl P\nflag.\nThe\n.Cm user\nkeyword matches against the target username on the remote host.\nThe\n.Cm localuser\nkeyword matches against the name of the local user running\n.Xr ssh 1\n(this keyword may be useful in system-wide\n.Nm\nfiles).\n.It Cm AddKeysToAgent\nSpecifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running\n.Xr ssh-agent 1 .\nIf this option is set to\n.Cm yes\nand a key is loaded from a file, the key and its passphrase are added to\nthe agent with the default lifetime, as if by\n.Xr ssh-add 1 .\nIf this option is set to\n.Cm ask ,\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill require confirmation using the\n.Ev SSH_ASKPASS\nprogram before adding a key (see\n.Xr ssh-add 1\nfor details).\nIf this option is set to\n.Cm confirm ,\neach use of the key must be confirmed, as if the\n.Fl c\noption was specified to\n.Xr ssh-add 1 .\nIf this option is set to\n.Cm no ,\nno keys are added to the agent.\nAlternately, this option may be specified as a time interval\nusing the format described in the\n.Sx TIME FORMATS\nsection of\n.Xr sshd_config 5\nto specify the key's lifetime in\n.Xr ssh-agent 1 ,\nafter which it will automatically be removed.\nThe argument must be\n.Cm no\n(the default),\n.Cm yes ,\n.Cm confirm\n(optionally followed by a time interval),\n.Cm ask\nor a time interval.\n.It Cm AddressFamily\nSpecifies which address family to use when connecting.\nValid arguments are\n.Cm any\n(the default),\n.Cm inet\n(use IPv4 only), or\n.Cm inet6\n(use IPv6 only).\n.It Cm BatchMode\nIf set to\n.Cm yes ,\nuser interaction such as password prompts and host key confirmation requests\nwill be disabled.\nThis option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where no user\nis present to interact with\n.Xr ssh 1 .\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.It Cm BindAddress\nUse the specified address on the local machine as the source address of\nthe connection.\nOnly useful on systems with more than one address.\n.It Cm BindInterface\nUse the address of the specified interface on the local machine as the\nsource address of the connection.\n.It Cm CanonicalDomains\nWhen\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\nis enabled, this option specifies the list of domain suffixes in which to\nsearch for the specified destination host.\n.It Cm CanonicalizeFallbackLocal\nSpecifies whether to fail with an error when hostname canonicalization fails.\nThe default,\n.Cm yes ,\nwill attempt to look up the unqualified hostname using the system resolver's\nsearch rules.\nA value of\n.Cm no\nwill cause\n.Xr ssh 1\nto fail instantly if\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\nis enabled and the target hostname cannot be found in any of the domains\nspecified by\n.Cm CanonicalDomains .\n.It Cm CanonicalizeHostname\nControls whether explicit hostname canonicalization is performed.\nThe default,\n.Cm no ,\nis not to perform any name rewriting and let the system resolver handle all\nhostname lookups.\nIf set to\n.Cm yes\nthen, for connections that do not use a\n.Cm ProxyCommand\nor\n.Cm ProxyJump ,\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill attempt to canonicalize the hostname specified on the command line\nusing the\n.Cm CanonicalDomains\nsuffixes and\n.Cm CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs\nrules.\nIf\n.Cm CanonicalizeHostname\nis set to\n.Cm always ,\nthen canonicalization is applied to proxied connections too.\n.Pp\nIf this option is enabled, then the configuration files are processed\nagain using the new target name to pick up any new configuration in matching\n.Cm Host\nand\n.Cm Match\nstanzas.\nA value of\n.Cm none\ndisables the use of a\n.Cm ProxyJump\nhost.\n.It Cm CanonicalizeMaxDots\nSpecifies the maximum number of dot characters in a hostname before\ncanonicalization is disabled.\nThe default, 1,\nallows a single dot (i.e. hostname.subdomain).\n.It Cm CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs\nSpecifies rules to determine whether CNAMEs should be followed when\ncanonicalizing hostnames.\nThe rules consist of one or more arguments of\n.Ar source_domain_list : Ns Ar target_domain_list ,\nwhere\n.Ar source_domain_list\nis a pattern-list of domains that may follow CNAMEs in canonicalization,\nand\n.Ar target_domain_list\nis a pattern-list of domains that they may resolve to.\n.Pp\nFor example,\n.Qq *.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com\nwill allow hostnames matching\n.Qq *.a.example.com\nto be canonicalized to names in the\n.Qq *.b.example.com\nor\n.Qq *.c.example.com\ndomains.\n.Pp\nA single argument of\n.Qq none\ncauses no CNAMEs to be considered for canonicalization.\nThis is the default behaviour.\n.It Cm CASignatureAlgorithms\nSpecifies which algorithms are allowed for signing of certificates\nby certificate authorities (CAs).\nThe default is:\n.Bd -literal -offset indent\nssh-ed25519,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,\necdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,\nsk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256\n.Ed\n.Pp\nIf the specified list begins with a\n.Sq +\ncharacter, then the specified algorithms will be appended to the default set\ninstead of replacing them.\nIf the specified list begins with a\n.Sq -\ncharacter, then the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed\nfrom the default set instead of replacing them.\n.Pp\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill not accept host certificates signed using algorithms other than those\nspecified.\n.It Cm CertificateFile\nSpecifies a file from which the user's certificate is read.\nA corresponding private key must be provided separately in order\nto use this certificate either\nfrom an\n.Cm IdentityFile\ndirective or\n.Fl i\nflag to\n.Xr ssh 1 ,\nvia\n.Xr ssh-agent 1 ,\nor via a\n.Cm PKCS11Provider\nor\n.Cm SecurityKeyProvider .\n.Pp\nArguments to\n.Cm CertificateFile\nmay use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory,\nthe tokens described in the\n.Sx TOKENS\nsection and environment variables as described in the\n.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\nsection.\n.Pp\nIt is possible to have multiple certificate files specified in\nconfiguration files; these certificates will be tried in sequence.\nMultiple\n.Cm CertificateFile\ndirectives will add to the list of certificates used for\nauthentication.\n.It Cm ChannelTimeout\nSpecifies whether and how quickly\n.Xr ssh 1\nshould close inactive channels.\nTimeouts are specified as one or more\n.Dq type=interval\npairs separated by whitespace, where the\n.Dq type\nmust be a channel type name (as described in the table below), optionally\ncontaining wildcard characters.\n.Pp\nThe timeout value\n.Dq interval\nis specified in seconds or may use any of the units documented in the\n.Sx TIME FORMATS\nsection.\nFor example,\n.Dq session=5m\nwould cause the interactive session to terminate after five minutes of\ninactivity.\nSpecifying a zero value disables the inactivity timeout.\n.Pp\nThe available channel types include:\n.Bl -tag -width Ds\n.It Cm agent-connection\nOpen connections to\n.Xr ssh-agent 1 .\n.It Cm direct-tcpip , Cm direct-streamlocal@openssh.com\nOpen TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that have\nbeen established from a\n.Xr ssh 1\nlocal forwarding, i.e.\\&\n.Cm LocalForward\nor\n.Cm DynamicForward .\n.It Cm forwarded-tcpip , Cm forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com\nOpen TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that have been\nestablished to a\n.Xr sshd 8\nlistening on behalf of a\n.Xr ssh 1\nremote forwarding, i.e.\\&\n.Cm RemoteForward .\n.It Cm session\nThe interactive main session, including shell session, command execution,\n.Xr scp 1 ,\n.Xr sftp 1 ,\netc.\n.It Cm tun-connection\nOpen\n.Cm TunnelForward\nconnections.\n.It Cm x11-connection\nOpen X11 forwarding sessions.\n.El\n.Pp\nNote that in all the above cases, terminating an inactive session does not\nguarantee to remove all resources associated with the session, e.g. shell\nprocesses or X11 clients relating to the session may continue to execute.\n.Pp\nMoreover, terminating an inactive channel or session does not necessarily\nclose the SSH connection, nor does it prevent a client from\nrequesting another channel of the same type.\nIn particular, expiring an inactive forwarding session does not prevent\nanother identical forwarding from being subsequently created.\n.Pp\nThe default is not to expire channels of any type for inactivity.\n.It Cm CheckHostIP\nIf set to\n.Cm yes ,\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill additionally check the host IP address in the\n.Pa known_hosts\nfile.\nThis allows it to detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing\nand will add addresses of destination hosts to\n.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts\nin the process, regardless of the setting of\n.Cm StrictHostKeyChecking .\nIf the option is set to\n.Cm no\n(the default),\nthe check will not be executed.\n.It Cm Ciphers\nSpecifies the ciphers allowed and their order of preference.\nMultiple ciphers must be comma-separated.\nIf the specified list begins with a\n.Sq +\ncharacter, then the specified ciphers will be appended to the default set\ninstead of replacing them.\nIf the specified list begins with a\n.Sq -\ncharacter, then the specified ciphers (including wildcards) will be removed\nfrom the default set instead of replacing them.\nIf the specified list begins with a\n.Sq ^\ncharacter, then the specified ciphers will be placed at the head of the\ndefault set.\n.Pp\nThe supported ciphers are:\n.Bd -literal -offset indent\n3des-cbc\naes128-cbc\naes192-cbc\naes256-cbc\naes128-ctr\naes192-ctr\naes256-ctr\naes128-gcm@openssh.com\naes256-gcm@openssh.com\nchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\n.Ed\n.Pp\nThe default is:\n.Bd -literal -offset indent\nchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,\naes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,\naes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com\n.Ed\n.Pp\nThe list of available ciphers may also be obtained using\n.Qq ssh -Q cipher .\n.It Cm ClearAllForwardings\nSpecifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port forwardings\nspecified in the configuration files or on the command line be\ncleared.\nThis option is primarily useful when used from the\n.Xr ssh 1\ncommand line to clear port forwardings set in\nconfiguration files, and is automatically set by\n.Xr scp 1\nand\n.Xr sftp 1 .\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.It Cm Compression\nSpecifies whether to use compression.\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.It Cm ConnectionAttempts\nSpecifies the number of tries (one per second) to make before exiting.\nThe argument must be an integer.\nThis may be useful in scripts if the connection sometimes fails.\nThe default is 1.\n.It Cm ConnectTimeout\nSpecifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the\nSSH server, instead of using the default system TCP timeout.\nThis timeout is applied both to establishing the connection and to performing\nthe initial SSH protocol handshake and key exchange.\n.It Cm ControlMaster\nEnables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection.\nWhen set to\n.Cm yes ,\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill listen for connections on a control socket specified using the\n.Cm ControlPath\nargument.\nAdditional sessions can connect to this socket using the same\n.Cm ControlPath\nwith\n.Cm ControlMaster\nset to\n.Cm no\n(the default).\nThese sessions will try to reuse the master instance's network connection\nrather than initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting normally\nif the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.\n.Pp\nSetting this to\n.Cm ask\nwill cause\n.Xr ssh 1\nto listen for control connections, but require confirmation using\n.Xr ssh-askpass 1 .\nIf the\n.Cm ControlPath\ncannot be opened,\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill continue without connecting to a master instance.\n.Pp\nX11 and\n.Xr ssh-agent 1\nforwarding is supported over these multiplexed connections, however the\ndisplay and agent forwarded will be the one belonging to the master\nconnection i.e. it is not possible to forward multiple displays or agents.\n.Pp\nTwo additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a\nmaster connection but fall back to creating a new one if one does not already\nexist.\nThese options are:\n.Cm auto\nand\n.Cm autoask .\nThe latter requires confirmation like the\n.Cm ask\noption.\n.It Cm ControlPath\nSpecify the path to the control socket used for connection sharing as described\nin the\n.Cm ControlMaster\nsection above or the string\n.Cm none\nto disable connection sharing.\nArguments to\n.Cm ControlPath\nmay use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory,\nthe tokens described in the\n.Sx TOKENS\nsection and environment variables as described in the\n.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\nsection.\nIt is recommended that any\n.Cm ControlPath\nused for opportunistic connection sharing include\nat least %h, %p, and %r (or alternatively %C) and be placed in a directory\nthat is not writable by other users.\nThis ensures that shared connections are uniquely identified.\n.It Cm ControlPersist\nWhen used in conjunction with\n.Cm ControlMaster ,\nspecifies that the master connection should remain open\nin the background (waiting for future client connections)\nafter the initial client connection has been closed.\nIf set to\n.Cm no\n(the default),\nthen the master connection will not be placed into the background,\nand will close as soon as the initial client connection is closed.\nIf set to\n.Cm yes\nor 0,\nthen the master connection will remain in the background indefinitely\n(until killed or closed via a mechanism such as the\n.Qq ssh -O exit ) .\nIf set to a time in seconds, or a time in any of the formats documented in\n.Xr sshd_config 5 ,\nthen the backgrounded master connection will automatically terminate\nafter it has remained idle (with no client connections) for the\nspecified time.\n.It Cm DynamicForward\nSpecifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded\nover the secure channel, and the application\nprotocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the\nremote machine.\n.Pp\nThe argument must be\n.Sm off\n.Oo Ar bind_address : Oc Ar port .\n.Sm on\nIPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.\nBy default, the local port is bound in accordance with the\n.Cm GatewayPorts\nsetting.\nHowever, an explicit\n.Ar bind_address\nmay be used to bind the connection to a specific address.\nThe\n.Ar bind_address\nof\n.Cm localhost\nindicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an\nempty address or\n.Sq *\nindicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.\n.Pp\nCurrently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill act as a SOCKS server.\nMultiple forwardings may be specified, and\nadditional forwardings can be given on the command line.\nOnly the superuser can forward privileged ports.\n.It Cm EnableEscapeCommandline\nEnables the command line option in the\n.Cm EscapeChar\nmenu for interactive sessions (default\n.Ql ~C ) .\nBy default, the command line is disabled.\n.It Cm EnableSSHKeysign\nSetting this option to\n.Cm yes\nin the global client configuration file\n.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config\nenables the use of the helper program\n.Xr ssh-keysign 8\nduring\n.Cm HostbasedAuthentication .\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\nThis option should be placed in the non-hostspecific section.\nSee\n.Xr ssh-keysign 8\nfor more information.\n.It Cm EscapeChar\nSets the escape character (default:\n.Ql ~ ) .\nThe escape character can also\nbe set on the command line.\nThe argument should be a single character,\n.Ql ^\nfollowed by a letter, or\n.Cm none\nto disable the escape\ncharacter entirely (making the connection transparent for binary\ndata).\n.It Cm ExitOnForwardFailure\nSpecifies whether\n.Xr ssh 1\nshould terminate the connection if it cannot set up all requested\ndynamic, tunnel, local, and remote port forwardings, (e.g.\\&\nif either end is unable to bind and listen on a specified port).\nNote that\n.Cm ExitOnForwardFailure\ndoes not apply to connections made over port forwardings and will not,\nfor example, cause\n.Xr ssh 1\nto exit if TCP connections to the ultimate forwarding destination fail.\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.It Cm FingerprintHash\nSpecifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints.\nValid options are:\n.Cm md5\nand\n.Cm sha256\n(the default).\n.It Cm ForkAfterAuthentication\nRequests\n.Nm ssh\nto go to background just before command execution.\nThis is useful if\n.Nm ssh\nis going to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user\nwants it in the background.\nThis implies the\n.Cm StdinNull\nconfiguration option being set to\n.Dq yes .\nThe recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with\nsomething like\n.Ic ssh -f host xterm ,\nwhich is the same as\n.Ic ssh host xterm\nif the\n.Cm ForkAfterAuthentication\nconfiguration option is set to\n.Dq yes .\n.Pp\nIf the\n.Cm ExitOnForwardFailure\nconfiguration option is set to\n.Dq yes ,\nthen a client started with the\n.Cm ForkAfterAuthentication\nconfiguration option being set to\n.Dq yes\nwill wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully established\nbefore placing itself in the background.\nThe argument to this keyword must be\n.Cm yes\n(same as the\n.Fl f\noption) or\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.It Cm ForwardAgent\nSpecifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any)\nwill be forwarded to the remote machine.\nThe argument may be\n.Cm yes ,\n.Cm no\n(the default),\nan explicit path to an agent socket or the name of an environment variable\n(beginning with\n.Sq $ )\nin which to find the path.\n.Pp\nAgent forwarding should be enabled with caution.\nUsers with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host\n(for the agent's Unix-domain socket)\ncan access the local agent through the forwarded connection.\nAn attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent,\nhowever they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to\nauthenticate using the identities loaded into the agent.\n.It Cm ForwardX11\nSpecifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected\nover the secure channel and\n.Ev DISPLAY\nset.\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.Pp\nX11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.\nUsers with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host\n(for the user's X11 authorization database)\ncan access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection.\nAn attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring\nif the\n.Cm ForwardX11Trusted\noption is also enabled.\n.It Cm ForwardX11Timeout\nSpecify a timeout for untrusted X11 forwarding\nusing the format described in the\n.Sx TIME FORMATS\nsection of\n.Xr sshd_config 5 .\nX11 connections received by\n.Xr ssh 1\nafter this time will be refused.\nSetting\n.Cm ForwardX11Timeout\nto zero will disable the timeout and permit X11 forwarding for the life\nof the connection.\nThe default is to disable untrusted X11 forwarding after twenty minutes has\nelapsed.\n.It Cm ForwardX11Trusted\nIf this option is set to\n.Cm yes ,\nremote X11 clients will have full access to the original X11 display.\n.Pp\nIf this option is set to\n.Cm no\n(the default),\nremote X11 clients will be considered untrusted and prevented\nfrom stealing or tampering with data belonging to trusted X11\nclients.\nFurthermore, the\n.Xr xauth 1\ntoken used for the session will be set to expire after 20 minutes.\nRemote clients will be refused access after this time.\n.Pp\nSee the X11 SECURITY extension specification for full details on\nthe restrictions imposed on untrusted clients.\n.It Cm GatewayPorts\nSpecifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local\nforwarded ports.\nBy default,\n.Xr ssh 1\nbinds local port forwardings to the loopback address.\nThis prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.\n.Cm GatewayPorts\ncan be used to specify that ssh\nshould bind local port forwardings to the wildcard address,\nthus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports.\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.It Cm GlobalKnownHostsFile\nSpecifies one or more files to use for the global\nhost key database, separated by whitespace.\nThe default is\n.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts ,\n.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2 .\n.It Cm GSSAPIAuthentication\nSpecifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed.\nThe default is\n.Cm no .\n.It Cm GSSAPIDelegateCredentials\nForward (delegate) credentials to the server.\nThe default is\n.Cm no .\n.It Cm HashKnownHosts\nIndicates that\n.Xr ssh

characters.\nMultiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or spread\nacross multiple\n.Cm SendEnv\ndirectives.\n.Pp\nSee\n.Sx PATTERNS\nfor more information on patterns.\n.Pp\nIt is possible to clear previously set\n.Cm SendEnv\nvariable names by prefixing patterns with\n.Pa - .\nThe default is not to send any environment variables.\n.It Cm ServerAliveCountMax\nSets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be\nsent without\n.Xr ssh 1\nreceiving any messages back from the server.\nIf this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being sent,\nssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session.\nIt is important to note that the use of server alive messages is very\ndifferent from\n.Cm TCPKeepAlive\n(below).\nThe server alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel\nand therefore will not be spoofable.\nThe TCP keepalive option enabled by\n.Cm TCPKeepAlive\nis spoofable.\nThe server alive mechanism is valuable when the client or\nserver depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.\n.Pp\nThe default value is 3.\nIf, for example,\n.Cm ServerAliveInterval\n(see below) is set to 15 and\n.Cm ServerAliveCountMax\nis left at the default, if the server becomes unresponsive,\nssh will disconnect after approximately 45 seconds.\n.It Cm ServerAliveInterval\nSets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received\nfrom the server,\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill send a message through the encrypted\nchannel to request a response from the server.\nThe default\nis 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the server.\n.It Cm SessionType\nMay be used to either request invocation of a subsystem on the remote system,\nor to prevent the execution of a remote command at all.\nThe latter is useful for just forwarding ports.\nThe argument to this keyword must be\n.Cm none\n(same as the\n.Fl N\noption),\n.Cm subsystem\n(same as the\n.Fl s\noption) or\n.Cm default\n(shell or command execution).\n.It Cm SetEnv\nDirectly specify one or more environment variables and their contents to\nbe sent to the server.\nSimilarly to\n.Cm SendEnv ,\nwith the exception of the\n.Ev TERM\nvariable, the server must be prepared to accept the environment variable.\n.It Cm StdinNull\nRedirects stdin from\n.Pa /dev/null\n(actually, prevents reading from stdin).\nEither this or the equivalent\n.Fl n\noption must be used when\n.Nm ssh\nis run in the background.\nThe argument to this keyword must be\n.Cm yes\n(same as the\n.Fl n\noption) or\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.It Cm StreamLocalBindMask\nSets the octal file creation mode mask\n.Pq umask\nused when creating a Unix-domain socket file for local or remote\nport forwarding.\nThis option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.\n.Pp\nThe default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is\nreadable and writable only by the owner.\nNote that not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain\nsocket files.\n.It Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink\nSpecifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file for local\nor remote port forwarding before creating a new one.\nIf the socket file already exists and\n.Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink\nis not enabled,\n.Nm ssh\nwill be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket file.\nThis option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.\n.Pp\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\n.It Cm StrictHostKeyChecking\nIf this flag is set to\n.Cm yes ,\n.Xr ssh 1\nwill never automatically add host keys to the\n.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts\nfile, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.\nThis provides maximum protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks,\nthough it can be annoying when the\n.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts\nfile is poorly maintained or when connections to new hosts are\nfrequently made.\nThis option forces the user to manually\nadd all new hosts.\n.Pp\nIf this flag is set to\n.Cm accept-new\nthen ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user's\n.Pa known_hosts\nfile, but will not permit connections to hosts with\nchanged host keys.\nIf this flag is set to\n.Cm no\nor\n.Cm off ,\nssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts files\nand allow connections to hosts with changed hostkeys to proceed,\nsubject to some restrictions.\nIf this flag is set to\n.Cm ask\n(the default),\nnew host keys\nwill be added to the user known host files only after the user\nhas confirmed that is what they really want to do, and\nssh will refuse to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.\nThe host keys of\nknown hosts will be verified automatically in all cases.\n.It Cm SyslogFacility\nGives the facility code that is used when logging messages from\n.Xr ssh 1 .\nThe possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,\nLOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.\nThe default is USER.\n.It Cm TCPKeepAlive\nSpecifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the\nother side.\nIf they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one\nof the machines will be properly noticed.\nHowever, this means that\nconnections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people\nfind it annoying.\n.Pp\nThe default is\n.Cm yes\n(to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice\nif the network goes down or the remote host dies.\nThis is important in scripts, and many users want it too.\n.Pp\nTo disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to\n.Cm no .\nSee also\n.Cm ServerAliveInterval\nfor protocol-level keepalives.\n.It Cm Tag\nSpecify a configuration tag name that may be later used by a\n.Cm Match\ndirective to select a block of configuration.\n.It Cm Tunnel\nRequest\n.Xr tun 4\ndevice forwarding between the client and the server.\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes ,\n.Cm point-to-point\n(layer 3),\n.Cm ethernet\n(layer 2),\nor\n.Cm no\n(the default).\nSpecifying\n.Cm yes\nrequests the default tunnel mode, which is\n.Cm point-to-point .\n.It Cm TunnelDevice\nSpecifies the\n.Xr tun 4\ndevices to open on the client\n.Pq Ar local_tun\nand the server\n.Pq Ar remote_tun .\n.Pp\nThe argument must be\n.Sm off\n.Ar local_tun Op : Ar remote_tun .\n.Sm on\nThe devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword\n.Cm any ,\nwhich uses the next available tunnel device.\nIf\n.Ar remote_tun\nis not specified, it defaults to\n.Cm any .\nThe default is\n.Cm any:any .\n.It Cm UpdateHostKeys\nSpecifies whether\n.Xr ssh 1\nshould accept notifications of additional hostkeys from the server sent\nafter authentication has completed and add them to\n.Cm UserKnownHostsFile .\nThe argument must be\n.Cm yes ,\n.Cm no\nor\n.Cm ask .\nThis option allows learning alternate hostkeys for a server\nand supports graceful key rotation by allowing a server to send replacement\npublic keys before old ones are removed.\n.Pp\nAdditional hostkeys are only accepted if the key used to authenticate the\nhost was already trusted or explicitly accepted by the user, the host was\nauthenticated via\n.Cm UserKnownHostsFile\n(i.e. not\n.Cm GlobalKnownHostsFile )\nand the host was authenticated using a plain key and not a certificate.\n.Pp\n.Cm UpdateHostKeys\nis enabled by default if the user has not overridden the default\n.Cm UserKnownHostsFile\nsetting and has not enabled\n.Cm VerifyHostKeyDNS ,\notherwise\n.Cm UpdateHostKeys\nwill be set to\n.Cm no .\n.Pp\nIf\n.Cm UpdateHostKeys\nis set to\n.Cm ask ,\nthen the user is asked to confirm the modifications to the known_hosts file.\nConfirmation is currently incompatible with\n.Cm ControlPersist ,\nand will be disabled if it is enabled.\n.Pp\nPresently, only\n.Xr sshd 8\nfrom OpenSSH 6.8 and greater support the\n.Qq hostkeys@openssh.com\nprotocol extension used to inform the client of all the server's hostkeys.\n.It Cm User\nSpecifies the user to log in as.\nThis can be useful when a different user name is used on different machines.\nThis saves the trouble of\nhaving to remember to give the user name on the command line.\n.It Cm UserKnownHostsFile\nSpecifies one or more files to use for the user\nhost key database, separated by whitespace.\nEach filename may use tilde notation to refer to the user's home directory,\nthe tokens described in the\n.Sx TOKENS\nsection and environment variables as described in the\n.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\nsection.\nA value of\n.Cm none\ncauses\n.Xr ssh 1\nto ignore any user-specific known hosts files.\nThe default is\n.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts ,\n.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts2 .\n.It Cm VerifyHostKeyDNS\nSpecifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource\nrecords.\nIf this option is set to\n.Cm yes ,\nthe client will implicitly trust keys that match a secure fingerprint\nfrom DNS.\nInsecure fingerprints will be handled as if this option was set to\n.Cm ask .\nIf this option is set to\n.Cm ask ,\ninformation on fingerprint match will be displayed, but the user will still\nneed to confirm new host keys according to the\n.Cm StrictHostKeyChecking\noption.\nThe default is\n.Cm no .\n.Pp\nSee also\n.Sx VERIFYING HOST KEYS\nin\n.Xr ssh 1 .\n.It Cm VisualHostKey\nIf this flag is set to\n.Cm yes ,\nan ASCII art representation of the remote host key fingerprint is\nprinted in addition to the fingerprint string at login and\nfor unknown host keys.\nIf this flag is set to\n.Cm no\n(the default),\nno fingerprint strings are printed at login and\nonly the fingerprint string will be printed for unknown host keys.\n.It Cm XAuthLocation\nSpecifies the full pathname of the\n.Xr xauth 1\nprogram.\nThe default is\n.Pa /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth .\n.El\n.Sh PATTERNS\nA\n.Em pattern\nconsists of zero or more non-whitespace characters,\n.Sq *\n(a wildcard that matches zero or more characters),\nor\n.Sq ?\\&\n(a wildcard that matches exactly one character).\nFor example, to specify a set of declarations for any host in the\n.Qq .co.uk\nset of domains,\nthe following pattern could be used:\n.Pp\n.Dl Host *.co.uk\n.Pp\nThe following pattern\nwould match any host in the 192.168.0.[0-9] network range:\n.Pp\n.Dl Host 192.168.0.?\n.Pp\nA\n.Em pattern-list\nis a comma-separated list of patterns.\nPatterns within pattern-lists may be negated\nby preceding them with an exclamation mark\n.Pq Sq !\\& .\nFor example,\nto allow a key to be used from anywhere within an organization\nexcept from the\n.Qq dialup\npool,\nthe following entry (in authorized_keys) could be used:\n.Pp\n.Dl from=\\&\"!*.dialup.example.com,*.example.com\\&\"\n.Pp\nNote that a negated match will never produce a positive result by itself.\nFor example, attempting to match\n.Qq host3\nagainst the following pattern-list will fail:\n.Pp\n.Dl from=\\&\"!host1,!host2\\&\"\n.Pp\nThe solution here is to include a term that will yield a positive match,\nsuch as a wildcard:\n.Pp\n.Dl from=\\&\"!host1,!host2,*\\&\"\n.Sh TOKENS\nArguments to some keywords can make use of tokens,\nwhich are expanded at runtime:\n.Pp\n.Bl -tag

%H\nThe\n.Pa known_hosts\nhostname or address that is being searched for.\n.It %h\nThe remote hostname.\n.It \\%%I\nA string describing the reason for a\n.Cm KnownHostsCommand\nexecution: either\n.Cm ADDRESS\nwhen looking up a host by address (only when\n.Cm CheckHostIP\nis enabled),\n.Cm HOSTNAME\nwhen searching by hostname, or\n.Cm ORDER\nwhen preparing the host key algorithm preference list to use for the\ndestination host.\n.It %i\nThe local user ID.\n.It %j\nThe contents of the ProxyJump option, or the empty string if this\noption is unset.\n.It %K\nThe base64 encoded host key.\n.It

directives build commands for execution via the shell.\nBecause\n.Xr ssh 1\nperforms no filtering or escaping of characters that have special meaning in\nshell commands (e.g. quotes), it is the user's responsibility to ensure that\nthe arguments passed to\n.Xr ssh 1\ndo not contain such characters and that tokens are appropriately quoted\nwhen used.\n.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\nArguments to some keywords can be expanded at runtime from environment\nvariables on the client by enclosing them in\n.Ic ${} ,\nfor example\n.Ic ${HOME}/.ssh\nwould refer to the user's .ssh directory.\nIf a specified environment variable does not exist then an error will be\nreturned and the setting for that keyword will be ignored.\n.Pp\nThe keywords\n.Cm CertificateFile ,\n.Cm ControlPath ,\n.Cm IdentityAgent ,\n.Cm IdentityFile ,\n.Cm KnownHostsCommand ,\nand\n.Cm UserKnownHostsFile\nsupport environment variables.\nThe keywords\n.Cm LocalForward\nand\n.Cm RemoteForward\nsupport environment variables only
