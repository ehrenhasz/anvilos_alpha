A second primality\n     testing pass, using ssh-keygen -M screen, provides a high degree of\n     assurance that the numbers are prime and are safe for use in Diffie-\n     Hellman operations by sshd(8).  This moduli format is used as the output\n     from each pass.\n\n     The file consists of newline-separated records, one per modulus,\n     containing seven space-separated fields.  These fields are as follows:\n\n           timestamp    The time that the modulus was last processed as\n                        YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.\n\n           type         Decimal number specifying the internal structure of\n                        the prime modulus.  Supported types are:\n\n                        0     Unknown, not tested.\n                        2     \"Safe\" prime; (p-1)/2 is also prime.\n                        4     Sophie Germain; 2p+1 is also prime.\n\n                        Moduli candidates initially produced by ssh-keygen(1)\n                        are Sophie Germain primes (type 4).  Further primality\n                        testing with ssh-keygen(1) produces safe prime moduli\n                        (type 2) that are ready for use in sshd(8).  Other\n                        types are not used by OpenSSH.\n\n           tests        Decimal number indicating the type of primality tests\n                        that the number has been subjected to represented as a\n                        bitmask of the following values:\n\n                        0x00  Not tested.\n                        0x01  Composite number M-bM-^@M-^S not prime.\n                        0x02  Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n                        0x04  Probabilistic Miller-Rabin primality tests.\n\n                        The ssh-keygen(1) moduli candidate generation uses the\n                        Sieve of Eratosthenes (flag 0x02).  Subsequent\n                        ssh-keygen(1) primality tests are Miller-Rabin tests\n                        (flag 0x04).\n\n           trials       Decimal number indicating the number of primality\n                        trials that have been performed on the modulus.\n\n           size         Decimal number indicating the size of the prime in\n                        bits.\n\n           generator    The recommended generator for use with this modulus\n                        (hexadecimal).\n\n           modulus      The modulus itself in hexadecimal.\n\n     When performing Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange, sshd(8) first estimates\n     the size of the modulus required to produce enough Diffie-Hellman output\n     to sufficiently key the selected symmetric cipher.  sshd(8) then randomly\n     selects a modulus from /etc/moduli that best meets the size requirement.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     ssh-keygen(1), sshd(8)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     M.
