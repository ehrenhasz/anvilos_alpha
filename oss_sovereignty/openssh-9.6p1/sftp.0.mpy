It may also use many\n     features of ssh, such as public key authentication and compression.\n\n     The destination may be specified either as [user@]host[:path] or as a URI\n     in the form sftp://[user@]host[:port][/path].\n\n     If the destination includes a path and it is not a directory, sftp will\n     retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive authentication method\n     is used; otherwise it will do so after successful interactive\n     authentication.\n\n     If no path is specified, or if the path is a directory, sftp will log in\n     to the specified host and enter interactive command mode, changing to the\n     remote directory if one was specified.  An optional trailing slash can be\n     used to force the path to be interpreted as a directory.\n\n     Since the destination formats use colon characters to delimit host names\n     from path names or port numbers, IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in\n     square brackets to avoid ambiguity.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -4      Forces sftp to use IPv4 addresses only.\n\n     -6      Forces sftp to use IPv6 addresses only.\n\n     -A      Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system.  The\n             default is not to forward an authentication agent.\n\n     -a      Attempt to continue interrupted transfers rather than overwriting\n             existing partial or complete copies of files.  If the partial\n             contents differ from those being transferred, then the resultant\n             file is likely to be corrupt.\n\n     -B buffer_size\n             Specify the size of the buffer that sftp uses when transferring\n             files.  Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of\n             higher memory consumption.  The default is 32768 bytes.\n\n     -b batchfile\n             Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input batchfile\n             instead of stdin.  Since it lacks user interaction, it should be\n             used in conjunction with non-interactive authentication to\n             obviate the need to enter a password at connection time (see\n             sshd(8) and ssh-keygen(1) for details).\n\n             A batchfile of M-bM-^@M-^X-M-bM-^@M-^Y may be used to indicate standard input.  sftp\n             will abort if any of the following commands fail: get, put,\n             reget, reput, rename, ln, rm, mkdir, chdir, ls, lchdir, copy, cp,\n             chmod, chown, chgrp, lpwd, df, symlink, and lmkdir.\n\n             Termination on error can be suppressed on a command by command\n             basis by prefixing the command with a M-bM-^@M-^X-M-bM-^@M-^Y character (for example,\n             -rm /tmp/blah*).  Echo of the command may be suppressed by\n             prefixing the command with a M-bM-^@M-^X@M-bM-^@M-^Y character.  These two prefixes\n             may be combined in any order, for example -@ls /bsd.\n\n     -C      Enables compression (via ssh's -C flag).\n\n     -c cipher\n             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfers.\n             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).\n\n     -D sftp_server_command\n             Connect directly to a local sftp server (rather than via ssh(1)).\n             A command and arguments may be specified, for example\n             \"/path/sftp-server -el debug3\".  This option may be useful in\n             debugging the client and server.\n\n     -F ssh_config\n             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh(1).\n             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).\n\n     -f      Requests that files be flushed to disk immediately after\n             transfer.  When uploading files, this feature is only enabled if\n             the server implements the \"fsync@openssh.com\" extension.\n\n     -i identity_file\n             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public\n             key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to\n             ssh(1).\n\n     -J destination\n             Connect to the target host by first making an sftp connection to\n             the jump host described by destination and then establishing a\n             TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple\n             jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.  This\n             is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration directive.\n             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).\n\n     -l limit\n             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.\n\n     -N      Disables quiet mode, e.g. to override the implicit quiet mode set\n             by the -b flag.\n\n     -o ssh_option\n             Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in\n             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which\n             there is no separate sftp command-line flag.  For example, to\n             specify an alternate port use: sftp -oPort=24.  For full details\n             of the options listed below, and their possible values, see\n             ssh_config(5).\n\n                   AddressFamily\n                   BatchMode\n                   BindAddress\n                   BindInterface\n                   CanonicalDomains\n                   CanonicalizeFallbackLocal\n                   CanonicalizeHostname\n                   CanonicalizeMaxDots\n                   CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs\n                   CASignatureAlgorithms\n                   CertificateFile\n                   CheckHostIP\n                   Ciphers\n                   Compression\n                   ConnectionAttempts\n                   ConnectTimeout\n                   ControlMaster\n                   ControlPath\n                   ControlPersist\n                   GlobalKnownHostsFile\n                   GSSAPIAuthentication\n                   GSSAPIDelegateCredentials\n                   HashKnownHosts\n                   Host\n                   HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms\n                   HostbasedAuthentication\n                   HostKeyAlgorithms\n                   HostKeyAlias\n                   Hostname\n                   IdentitiesOnly\n                   IdentityAgent\n                   IdentityFile\n                   IPQoS\n                   KbdInteractiveAuthentication\n                   KbdInteractiveDevices\n                   KexAlgorithms\n                   KnownHostsCommand\n                   LogLevel\n                   MACs\n                   NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost\n                   NumberOfPasswordPrompts\n                   PasswordAuthentication\n                   PKCS11Provider\n                   Port\n                   PreferredAuthentications\n                   ProxyCommand\n                   ProxyJump\n                   PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms\n                   PubkeyAuthentication\n                   RekeyLimit\n                   RequiredRSASize\n                   SendEnv\n                   ServerAliveInterval\n                   ServerAliveCountMax\n                   SetEnv\n                   StrictHostKeyChecking\n                   TCPKeepAlive\n                   UpdateHostKeys\n                   User\n                   UserKnownHostsFile\n                   VerifyHostKeyDNS\n\n     -P port\n             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.\n\n     -p      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the\n             original files transferred.\n\n     -q      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and\n             diagnostic messages from ssh(1).\n\n     -R num_requests\n             Specify how many requests may be outstanding at any one time.\n             Increasing this may slightly improve file transfer speed but will\n             increase memory usage.  The default is 64 outstanding requests.\n\n     -r      Recursively copy entire directories when uploading and\n             downloading.  Note that sftp does not follow symbolic links\n             encountered in the tree traversal.\n\n     -S program\n             Name of the program to use for the encrypted connection.  The\n             program must understand ssh(1) options.\n\n     -s subsystem | sftp_server\n             Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server on\n             the remote host.  A path is useful when the remote sshd(8) does\n             not have an sftp subsystem configured.\n\n     -v      Raise logging level.  This option is also passed to ssh.\n\n     -X sftp_option\n             Specify an option that controls aspects of SFTP protocol\n             behaviour.  The valid options are:\n\n             nrequests=value\n                     Controls how many concurrent SFTP read or write requests\n                     may be in progress at any point in time during a download\n                     or upload.  By default 64 requests may be active\n                     concurrently.\n\n             buffer=value\n                     Controls the maximum buffer size for a single SFTP\n                     read/write operation used during download or upload.  By\n                     default a 32KB buffer is used.\n\nINTERACTIVE COMMANDS\n     Once in interactive mode, sftp understands a set of commands similar to\n     those of ftp(1).  Commands are case insensitive.  Pathnames that contain\n     spaces must be enclosed in quotes.  Any special characters contained\n     within pathnames that are recognized by glob(3) must be escaped with\n     backslashes (M-bM-^@M-^X\\M-bM-^@M-^Y).\n\n     bye     Quit sftp.\n\n     cd [path]\n             Change remote directory to path.  If path is not specified, then\n             change directory to the one the session started in.\n\n     chgrp [-h] grp path\n             Change group of file path to grp.  path may contain glob(7)\n             characters and may match multiple files.  grp must be a numeric\n             GID.\n\n             If the -h flag is specified, then symlinks will not be followed.\n             Note that this is only supported by servers that implement the\n             \"lsetstat@openssh.com\" extension.\n\n     chmod [-h] mode path\n             Change permissions of file path to mode.  path may contain\n             glob(7) characters and may match multiple files.\n\n             If the -h flag is specified, then symlinks will not be followed.\n             Note that this is only supported by servers that implement the\n             \"lsetstat@openssh.com\" extension.\n\n     chown [-h] own path\n             Change owner of file path to own.  path may contain glob(7)\n             characters and may match multiple files.  own must be a numeric\n             UID.\n\n             If the -h flag is specified, then symlinks will not be followed.\n             Note that this is only supported by servers that implement the\n             \"lsetstat@openssh.com\" extension.\n\n     copy oldpath newpath\n             Copy remote file from oldpath to newpath.\n\n             Note that this is only supported by servers that implement the\n             \"copy-data\" extension.\n\n     cp oldpath newpath\n             Alias to copy command.\n\n     df [-hi] [path]\n             Display usage information for the filesystem holding the current\n             directory (or path if specified).  If the -h flag is specified,\n             the capacity information will be displayed using \"human-readable\"\n             suffixes.  The -i flag requests display of inode information in\n             addition to capacity information.  This command is only supported\n             on servers that implement the M-bM-^@M-^\\statvfs@openssh.comM-bM-^@M-^] extension.\n\n     exit    Quit sftp.\n\n     get [-afpR] remote-path [local-path]\n             Retrieve the remote-path and store it on the local machine.  If\n             the local path name is not specified, it is given the same name\n             it has on the remote machine.  remote-path may contain glob(7)\n             characters and may match multiple files.  If it does and\n             local-path is specified, then local-path must specify a\n             directory.\n\n             If the -a flag is specified, then attempt to resume partial\n             transfers of existing files.  Note that resumption assumes that\n             any partial copy of the local file matches the remote copy.  If\n             the remote file contents differ from the partial local copy then\n             the resultant file is likely to be corrupt.\n\n             If the -f flag is specified, then fsync(2) will be called after\n             the file transfer has completed to flush the file to disk.\n\n             If the -p flag is specified, then full file permissions and\n             access times are copied too.\n\n             If the -R flag is specified then directories will be copied\n             recursively.  Note that sftp does not follow symbolic links when\n             performing recursive transfers.\n\n     help    Display help text.\n\n     lcd [path]\n             Change local directory to path.  If path is not specified, then\n             change directory to the local user's home directory.\n\n     lls [ls-options [path]]\n             Display local directory listing of either path or current\n             directory if path is not specified.  ls-options may contain any\n             flags supported by the local system's ls(1) command.  path may\n             contain glob(7) characters and may match multiple files.\n\n     lmkdir path\n             Create local directory specified by path.\n\n     ln [-s] oldpath newpath\n             Create a link from oldpath to newpath.  If the -s flag is\n             specified the created link is a symbolic link, otherwise it is a\n             hard link.\n\n     lpwd    Print local working directory.\n\n     ls [-1afhlnrSt] [path]\n             Display a remote directory listing of either path or the current\n             directory if path is not specified.  path may contain glob(7)\n             characters and may match multiple files.\n\n             The following flags are recognized and alter the behaviour of ls\n             accordingly:\n\n             -1      Produce single columnar output.\n\n             -a      List files beginning with a dot (M-bM-^@M-^X.M-bM-^@M-^Y).\n\n             -f      Do not sort the listing.  The default sort order is\n                     lexicographical.\n\n             -h      When used with a long format option, use unit suffixes:\n                     Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte,\n                     and Exabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to\n                     four or fewer using powers of 2 for sizes (K=1024,\n                     M=1048576, etc.).\n\n             -l      Display additional details including permissions and\n                     ownership information.\n\n             -n      Produce a long listing with user and group information\n                     presented numerically.\n\n             -r      Reverse the sort order of the listing.\n\n             -S      Sort the listing by file size.\n\n             -t      Sort the listing by last modification time.\n\n     lumask umask\n             Set local umask to umask.\n\n     mkdir path\n             Create remote directory specified by path.\n\n     progress\n             Toggle display of progress meter.\n\n     put [-afpR] local-path [remote-path]\n             Upload local-path and store it on the remote machine.  If the\n             remote path name is not specified, it is given the same name it\n             has on the local machine.  local-path may contain glob(7)\n             characters and may match multiple files.  If it does and\n             remote-path is specified, then remote-path must specify a\n             directory.\n\n             If the -a flag is specified, then attempt to resume partial\n             transfers of existing files.  Note that resumption assumes that\n             any partial copy of the remote file matches the local copy.  If\n             the local file contents differ from the remote local copy then\n             the resultant file is likely to be corrupt.\n\n             If the -f flag is specified, then a request will be sent to the\n             server to call fsync(2) after the file has been transferred.\n             Note that this is only supported by servers that implement the\n             \"fsync@openssh.com\" extension.\n\n             If the -p flag is specified, then full file permissions and\n             access times are copied too.\n\n             If the -R flag is specified then directories will be copied\n             recursively.
