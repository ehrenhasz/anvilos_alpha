See sshd_config(5) for more information.\n\n     Valid options are:\n\n     -d start_directory\n             Specifies an alternate starting directory for users.  The\n             pathname may contain the following tokens that are expanded at\n             runtime: %% is replaced by a literal '%', %d is replaced by the\n             home directory of the user being authenticated, and %u is\n             replaced by the username of that user.  The default is to use the\n             user's home directory.  This option is useful in conjunction with\n             the sshd_config(5) ChrootDirectory option.\n\n     -e      Causes sftp-server to print logging information to stderr instead\n             of syslog for debugging.\n\n     -f log_facility\n             Specifies the facility code that is used when logging messages\n             from sftp-server.  The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH,\n             LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.\n             The default is AUTH.\n\n     -h      Displays sftp-server usage information.\n\n     -l log_level\n             Specifies which messages will be logged by sftp-server.  The\n             possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG,\n             DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  INFO and VERBOSE log transactions\n             that sftp-server performs on behalf of the client.  DEBUG and\n             DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher\n             levels of debugging output.  The default is ERROR.\n\n     -P denied_requests\n             Specifies a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that\n             are banned by the server.  sftp-server will reply to any denied\n             request with a failure.  The -Q flag can be used to determine the\n             supported request types.  If both denied and allowed lists are\n             specified, then the denied list is applied before the allowed\n             list.\n\n     -p allowed_requests\n             Specifies a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that\n             are permitted by the server.  All request types that are not on\n             the allowed list will be logged and replied to with a failure\n             message.\n\n             Care must be taken when using this feature to ensure that\n             requests made implicitly by SFTP clients are permitted.\n\n     -Q protocol_feature\n             Queries protocol features supported by sftp-server.  At present\n             the only feature that may be queried is M-bM-^@M-^\\requestsM-bM-^@M-^], which may be\n             used to deny or allow specific requests (flags -P and -p\n             respectively).\n\n     -R      Places this instance of sftp-server into a read-only mode.\n             Attempts to open files for writing, as well as other operations\n             that change the state of the filesystem, will be denied.\n\n     -u umask\n             Sets an explicit umask(2) to be applied to newly-created files\n             and directories, instead of the user's default mask.\n\n     On some systems, sftp-server must be able to access /dev/log for logging\n     to work, and use of sftp-server in a chroot configuration therefore\n     requires that syslogd(8) establish a logging socket inside the chroot\n     directory.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     sftp(1), ssh(1), sshd_config(5), sshd(8)\n\n     T.
