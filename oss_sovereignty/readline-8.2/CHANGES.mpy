  "human_readable_source": "This document details the changes between this version, readline-8.2, and\nthe previous version, readline-8.1.\n\n1. Changes to Readline\n\na. Fixed a problem with cleaning up active marks when using callback mode.\n\nb. Fixed a problem with arithmetic comparison operators checking the version.\n\nc. Fixed a problem that could cause readline not to build on systems without\n   POSIX signal functions.\n\nd. Fixed a bug that could cause readline to crash if the application removed\n   the callback line handler before readline read all typeahead.\n\ne. Added additional checks for read errors in the middle of readline commands.\n\nf. Fixed a redisplay problem that occurred when switching from the digit-\n   argument prompt `(arg: N)' back to the regular prompt and the regular\n   prompt contained invisible characters.\n\ng. Fixed a problem with restoring the prompt when aborting an incremental\n   search.\n\nh. Fix a problem with characters > 128 not being displayed correctly in certain\n   single-byte encodings.\n\ni. Fixed a problem with unix-filename-rubout that caused it to delete too much\n   when applied to a pathname consisting only of one or more slashes.\n\nj. Fixed a display problem that caused the prompt to be wrapped incorrectly if\n   the screen changed dimensions during a call to readline() and the prompt\n   became longer than the screen width.\n\nk. Fixed a problem that caused the \\r output by turning off bracketed paste\n   to overwrite the line if terminal echo was disabled.\n\nl. Fixed a bug that could cause colored-completion-prefix to not display if\n   completion-prefix-display-length was set.\n\nm. Fixed a problem with line wrapping prompts when a group of invisible\n   characters runs to the right edge of the screen and the prompt extends\n   longer then the screen width.\n\nn. Fixed a couple problems that could cause rl_end to be set incorrectly by\n   transpose-words.\n\no. Prevent some display problems when running a command as the result of a\n   trap or one bound using `bind -x' and the command generates output.\n\np. Fixed an issue with multi-line prompt strings that have one or more\n   invisible characters at the end of a physical line.\n\nq. Fixed an issue that caused a history line's undo list to be cleared when\n   it should not have been.\n\nr. When replacing a history entry, make sure the existing entry has a non-NULL\n   timestamp before copying it; it may have been added by the application, not\n   the history library.\n\n2. New Features in Readline\n\na. There is now an HS_HISTORY_VERSION containing the version number of the\n   history library for applications to use.\n\nb. History expansion better understands multiple history expansions that may\n   contain strings that would ordinarily inhibit history expansion (e.g.,\n   `abc!$!$').\n\nc. There is a new framework for readline timeouts, including new public\n   functions to set timeouts and query how much time is remaining before a\n   timeout hits, and a hook function that can trigger when readline times\n   out. There is a new state value to indicate a timeout.\n\nd. Automatically bind termcap key sequences for page-up and page-down to\n   history-search-backward and history-search-forward, respectively.\n\ne. There is a new `fetch-history' bindable command that retrieves the history\n   entry corresponding to its numeric argument. Negative arguments count back\n   from the end of the history.\n\nf. `vi-undo' is now a bindable command.\n\ng. There is a new option: `enable-active-region'. This separates control of\n   the active region and bracketed-paste. It has the same default value as\n   bracketed-paste, and enabling bracketed paste enables the active region.\n   Users can now turn off the active region while leaving bracketed paste\n   enabled.\n\nh. rl_completer_word_break_characters is now `const char *' like\n   rl_basic_word_break_characters.\n\ni. Readline looks in $LS_COLORS for a custom filename extension\n   (*.readline-colored-completion-prefix) and uses that as the default color\n   for the common prefix displayed when `colored-completion-prefix' is set.\n\nj. Two new bindable string variables: active-region-start-color and\n   active-region-end-color. The first sets the color used to display the\n   active region; the second turns it off. If set, these are used in place\n   of terminal standout mode.\n\nk. New readline state (RL_STATE_EOF) and application-visible variable\n   (rl_eof_found) to allow applications to detect when readline reads EOF\n   before calling the deprep-terminal hook.\n\nl. There is a new configuration option: --with-shared-termcap-library, which\n   forces linking the shared readline library with the shared termcap (or\n   curses/ncurses/termlib) library so applications don't have to do it.\n\nm. Readline now checks for changes to locale settings (LC_ALL/LC_CTYPE/LANG)\n   each time it is called, and modifies the appropriate locale-specific display\n   and key binding variables when the locale changes.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-8.1, and\nthe previous version, readline-8.0.\n\n1. Changes to Readline\n\na. There are a number of fixes that were found as the result of fuzzing with\n   random input.\n\nb. Changed the revert-all-at-newline behavior to make sure to start at the end\n   of the history list when doing it, instead of the line where the user hit\n   return.\n\nc. When parsing `set' commands from the inputrc file or an application, readline\n   now allows trailing whitespace.\n\nd. Fixed a bug that left a file descriptor open to the history file if the\n   file size was 0.\n\ne. Fixed a problem with binding key sequences containing meta characters.\n\nf. Fixed a bug that caused the wrong line to be displayed if the user tried to\n   move back beyond the beginning of the history list, or forward past the end\n   of the history list.\n\ng. If readline catches SIGTSTP, it now sets a hook that allows the calling\n   application to handle it if it desires.\n\nh. Fixed a redisplay problem with a prompt string containing embedded newlines.\n\ni. Fixed a problem with completing filenames containing invalid multibyte\n   sequences when case-insensitive comparisons are enabled.\n\nj. Fixed a redisplay problem with prompt strings containing invisible multibyte\n   characters.\n\nk. Fixed a problem with multibyte characters mapped to editing commands that\n   modify the search string in incremental search.\n\nl. Fixed a bug with maintaining the key sequence while resolving a bound\n   command in the presence of ambiguous sequences (sequences with a common\n   prefix), in most cases while attempting to unbind it.\n\nm. Fixed several buffer overflows found as the result of fuzzing.\n\nn. Reworked backslash handling when translating key sequences for key binding\n   to be more uniform and consistent, which introduces a slight backwards\n   incompatibility.\n\no. Fixed a bug with saving the history that resulted in errors not being\n   propagated to the calling application when the history file is not writable.\n\np. Readline only calls chown(2) on a newly-written history file if it really\n   needs to, instead of having it be a no-op.\n\nq. Readline now behaves better when operate-and-get-next is used when the\n   history list is `full': when there are already $HISTSIZE entries.\n\nr. Fixed a bug that could cause vi redo (`.') of a replace command not to work\n   correctly in the C or POSIX locale.\n\ns. Fixed a bug with vi-mode digit arguments that caused the last command to be\n   set incorrectly. This prevents yank-last-arg from working as intended, for\n   example.\n\nt. Make sure that all undo groups are closed when leaving vi insertion mode.  \n\nu. Make sure that the vi-mode `C' and `c' commands enter insert mode even if\n   the motion command doesn't have any effect.\n\nv. Fixed several potential memory leaks in the callback mode context handling.\n\nw. If readline is handling a SIGTTOU, make sure SIGTTOU is blocked while\n   executing the terminal cleanup code, since it's no longer run in a signal\n   handling context.\n\nx. Fixed a bug that could cause an application with an application-specific \n   redisplay function to crash if the line data structures had not been\n   initialized.\n\ny. Terminals that are named \"dumb\" or unknown do not enable bracketed paste\n   by default.\n\nz. Ensure that disabling bracketed paste turns off highlighting the incremental\n   search string when the search is successful.\n\n2. New Features in Readline\n\na. If a second consecutive completion attempt produces matches where the first\n   did not, treat it as a new completion attempt and insert a match as\n   appropriate.\n\nb. Bracketed paste mode works in more places: incremental search strings, vi\n   overstrike mode, character search, and reading numeric arguments.\n\nc. Readline automatically switches to horizontal scrolling if the terminal has\n   only one line.\n\nd. Unbinding all key sequences bound to a particular readline function now\n   descends into keymaps for multi-key sequences.\n\ne. rl-clear-display: new bindable command that clears the screen and, if\n   possible, the scrollback buffer (bound to emacs mode M-C-l by default).\n\nf. New active mark and face feature: when enabled, it will highlight the text\n   inserted by a bracketed paste (the `active region') and the text found by\n   incremental and non-incremental history searches. This is tied to bracketed\n   paste and can be disabled by turning off bracketed paste.\n\ng. Readline sets the mark in several additional commands.\n\nh. Bracketed paste mode is enabled by default. There is a configure-time\n   option (--enable-bracketed-paste-default) to set the default to on or off.\n\ni. Readline tries to take advantage of the more regular structure of UTF-8\n   characters to identify the beginning and end of characters when moving\n   through the line buffer.\n\nj. The bindable operate-and-get-next command (and its default bindings) are\n   now part of readline instead of a bash-specific addition.\n\nk. The signal cleanup code now blocks SIGINT while processing after a SIGINT.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-8.0, and the\nprevious version, readline-7.0.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na. Added a guard to prevent nested macros from causing an infinite expansion\n   loop.\n\nb. Instead of allocating enough history list entries to hold the maximum list\n   size, cap the number allocated initially.\n   \nc. Added a strategy to avoid allocating huge amounts of memory if a block of\n   history entries without timestamps occurs after a block with timestamps.\n\nd. Added support for keyboard timeouts when an ESC character is the last\n   character in a macro.\n\ne. There are several performance improvements when in a UTF-8 locale.\n\nf. Readline does a better job of preserving the original set of blocked\n   signals when using pselect() to wait for input.\n\ng. Fixed a bug that caused multibyte characters in macros to be mishandled.\n\nh. Fixed several bugs in the code that calculates line breaks when expanding\n   prompts that span several lines, contain multibyte characters, and contain\n   invisible character seqeuences.\n\ni. Fixed several bugs in cursor positioning when displaying lines with prompts\n   containing invisible characters and multibyte characters.\n\nj. When performing case-insensitive completion, Readline no longer sorts the\n   list of matches unless directed to do so.\n\nk. Fixed a problem with key sequences ending with a backslash.\n\nl. Fixed out-of-bounds and free memory read errors found via fuzzing.\n\nm. Fixed several cases where the mark was set to an invalid value.\n\nn. Fixed a problem with the case-changing operators in the case where the\n   lower and upper case versions of a character do not have the same number\n   of bytes.\n\no. Handle incremental and non-incremental search character reads returning EOF.\n\np. Handle the case where a failing readline command at the end of a multi-key\n   sequence could be misinterpreted.\n\nq. The history library now prints a meaningful error message if the history\n   file isn't a regular file.\n\nr. Fixed a problem with vi-mode redo (`.') on a command when trying to replace\n   a multibyte character.\n\ns. The key binding code now attempts to remove a keymap if a key unbinding\n   leaves it empty.\n\nt. Fixed a line-wrapping issue that caused problems for some terminal\n   emulators.\n\nu. If there is a key bound to the tty's VDISCARD special character, readline\n   disables VDISCARD while it is active.\n\nv. Fixed a problem with exiting bracketed paste mode on terminals that assume\n   the bracketed paste mode character sequence contains visible characters.\n\nw. Fixed a bug that could cause a key binding command to refer to an\n   uninitialized variable.\n\nx. Added more UTF-8-specific versions of multibyte functions, and optimized\n   existing functions if the current locale uses UTF-8 encoding.\n\ny. Fixed a problem with bracketed-paste inserting more than one character and\n   interacting with other readline functions.\n\nz. Fixed a bug that caused the history library to attempt to append a history\n   line to a non-existent history entry.\n\naa. If using bracketed paste mode, output a newline after the \\r that is the\n    last character of the mode disable string to avoid overwriting output.\n\nbb. Fixes to the vi-mode `b', `B', `w', `W', `e', and `E' commands to better\n    handle multibyte characters.\n\ncc. Fixed a redisplay problem that caused an extra newline to be generated on\n    accept-line when the line length is exactly the screenwidth.\n\ndd. Fixed a bug with adding multibyte characters to an incremental search\n    string.\n\nee. Fixed a bug with redoing text insertions in vi mode.\n\nff. Fixed a bug with pasting text into an incremental search string if bracketed\n    paste mode is enabled. ESC cannot be one of the incremental search\n    terminator characters for this to work.\n\ngg. Fixed a bug with anchored search patterns when performing searches in vi\n    mode.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na. Non-incremental vi-mode search (`N', `n') can search for a shell pattern, as\n   Posix specifies (uses fnmatch(3) if available).\n\nb. There are new `next-screen-line' and `previous-screen-line' bindable\n   commands, which move the cursor to the same column in the next, or previous,\n   physical line, respectively.\n\nc. There are default key bindings for control-arrow-key key combinations.\n\nd. A negative argument (-N) to `quoted-insert' means to insert the next N\n   characters using quoted-insert.\n\ne. New public function: rl_check_signals(), which allows applications to\n   respond to signals that readline catches while waiting for input using\n   a custom read function.\n\nf. There is new support for conditionally testing the readline version in an\n   inputrc file, with a full set of arithmetic comparison operators available.\n\ng. There is a simple variable comparison facility available for use within an\n   inputrc file. Allowable operators are equality and inequality; string\n   variables may be compared to a value; boolean variables must be compared to\n   either `on' or `off'; variable names are separated from the operator by\n   whitespace.\n\nh. The history expansion library now understands command and process\n   substitution and extended globbing and allows them to appear anywhere in a\n   word.\n\ni. The history library has a new variable that allows applications to set the\n   initial quoting state, so quoting state can be inherited from a previous\n   line.\n\nj. Readline now allows application-defined keymap names; there is a new public\n   function, rl_set_keymap_name(), to do that.\n\nk. The \"Insert\" keypad key, if available, now puts readline into overwrite\n   mode.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-7.0, and the\nprevious version, readline-6.3.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  A bug that caused vi-mode `.' to be unable to redo `c', `d', and `y'\n    commands with modifiers was fixed.\n\nb.  Fixed a bug that caused callback mode to dump core when reading a\n    multiple-key sequence (e.g., arrow keys).\n\nc.  Fixed a bug that caused the redisplay code to erase some of the line when\n    using horizontal scrolling with incremental search.\n\nd.  Readline's input handler now performs signal processing if read(2) is\n    interrupted by SIGALRM or SIGVTALRM.\n\ne.  Fixed a problem with revert-all-at-newline freeing freed memory.\n\nf.  Clarified the documentation for the history_quotes_inhibit_expansion\n    variable to note that it inhibits scanning for the history comment\n    character and that it only affects double-quoted strings.\n\ng.  Fixed an off-by-one error in the prompt printed when performing searches.\n\nh.  Use pselect(2), if available, to wait for input before calling read(2), so\n    a SIGWINCH can interrupt it, since it doesn't interrupt read(2).\n\ni.  Some memory leaks caused by signals interrupting filename completion have\n    been fixed.\n\nj.  Reading EOF twice on a non-empty line causes EOF to be returned, rather\n    than the partial line.  This can cause partial lines to be executed on\n    SIGHUP, for example.\n\nk.  Fixed a bug concerning deleting multibyte characters from the search\n    string while performing an incremental search.\n\nl.  Fixed a bug with tilde expanding directory names in filename completion.\n\nm.  Fixed a bug that did not allow binding sequences beginning with a `\\'.\n\nn.  Fixed a redisplay bug involving incorrect line wrapping when the prompt\n    contains a multibyte character in the last screen column.\n\no.  Fixed a bug that caused history expansion to disregard characters that are\n    documented to delimit a history event specifier without requiring `:'.\n\np.  Fixed a bug that could cause reading past the end of a string when reading\n    the value when binding the set of isearch terminators.\n\nq.  Fixed a bug that caused readline commands that depend on knowing which  \n    key invoked them to misbehave when dispatching key sequences that are\n    prefixes of other key bindings. \n\nr.  Paren matching now works in vi insert mode.\n\ns.  Colored completion prefixes are now displayed using a different color, less\n    likely to collide with files.\n\nt.  Fixed a bug that caused vi-mode character search to misbehave when\n    running in callback mode.\n\nu.  Fixed a bug that caused output to be delayed when input is coming from a\n    macro in vi-mode.\n\nv.  Fixed a bug that caused the vi-mode `.' command to misbehave when redoing\n    a multi-key key sequence via a macro.\n\nw.  Fixed a bug that caused problems with applications that supply their own\n    input function when performing completion.\n\nx.  When read returns -1/EIO when attempting to read a key, return an error\n    instead of line termination back to the caller.\n\ny.  Updated tty auditing feature based on patch from Red Hat.\n\nz.  Fixed a bug that could cause the history library to crash on overflows\n    introduced by malicious editing of timestamps in the history file.\n\naa. The history file writing functions only attempt to create and use a backup\n    history file if the history file exists and is a regular file.\n\nbb. Fixed an out-of-bounds read in readline's internal tilde expansion interface.\n\ncc. Fixed several redisplay bugs with prompt strings containing multibyte\n    and non-visible characters whose physical length is longer than the screen\n    width.\n\ndd. Fixed a redisplay bug with prompt strings containing invisible characters\n    whose physical length exceeds the screen width and using incremental search.\n\nee. Readline prints more descriptive error messages when it encounters errors\n    while reading an inputrc file.\n\nff. Fixed a bug in the character insertion code that attempts to optimize\n    typeahead when it reads a character that is not bound to self-insert and\n    resets the key sequence state.\n\ngg.  When refreshing the line as the result of a key sequence, Readline attempts\n     to redraw only the last line of a multiline prompt.\n\nhh.  Fixed an issue that caused completion of git commands to display\n     incorrectly when using colored-completion-prefix.\n\nii.  Fixed several redisplay bugs having to do with multibyte characters and\n     invisible characters in prompt strings.\n\njj. Fixed a bug that caused mode strings to be displayed incorrectly if the\n    prompt was shorter than the mode string.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  The history truncation code now uses the same error recovery mechanism as\n    the history writing code, and restores the old version of the history file\n    on error.  The error recovery mechanism handles symlinked history files.\n\nb.  There is a new bindable variable, `enable-bracketed-paste', which enables\n    support for a terminal's bracketed paste mode.\n\nc.  The editing mode indicators can now be strings and are user-settable\n    (new `emacs-mode-string', `vi-cmd-mode-string' and `vi-ins-mode-string'\n    variables).  Mode strings can contain invisible character sequences.\n    Setting mode strings to null strings restores the defaults.\n\nd.  Prompt expansion adds the mode string to the last line of a multi-line\n    prompt (one with embedded newlines).\n\ne.  There is a new bindable variable, `colored-completion-prefix', which, if\n    set, causes the common prefix of a set of possible completions to be\n    displayed in color.\n\nf.  There is a new bindable command `vi-yank-pop', a vi-mode version of emacs-\n    mode yank-pop.\n\ng.  The redisplay code underwent several efficiency improvements for multibyte\n    locales.\n\nh.  The insert-char function attempts to batch-insert all pending typeahead\n    that maps to self-insert, as long as it is coming from the terminal.\n\ni.  rl_callback_sigcleanup: a new application function that can clean up and\n    unset any state set by readline's callback mode.  Intended to be used\n    after a signal.\n\nj.  If an incremental search string has its last character removed with DEL, the\n    resulting empty search string no longer matches the previous line.\n\nk.  If readline reads a history file that begins with `#' (or the value of\n    the history comment character) and has enabled history timestamps, the history\n    entries are assumed to be delimited by timestamps.  This allows multi-line\n    history entries.\n\nl.  Readline now throws an error if it parses a key binding without a terminating\n    `:' or whitespace.\n\nm.  The default binding for ^W in vi mode now uses word boundaries specified\n    by Posix (vi-unix-word-rubout is bindable command name).\n\nn.  rl_clear_visible_line: new application-callable function; clears all\n    screen lines occupied by the current visible readline line.\n\no.  rl_tty_set_echoing: application-callable function that controls whether\n    or not readline thinks it is echoing terminal output.\n\np.  Handle >| and strings of digits preceding and following redirection\n    specifications as single tokens when tokenizing the line for history\n    expansion.\n\nq.  Fixed a bug with displaying completions when the prefix display length\n    is greater than the length of the completions to be displayed.\n\nr.  The :p history modifier now applies to the entire line, so any expansion\n    specifying :p causes the line to be printed instead of expanded.\n\ns.  New application-callable function: rl_pending_signal(): returns the signal\n    number of any signal readline has caught but not yet handled.\n    \nt.  New application-settable variable: rl_persistent_signal_handlers: if set\n    to a non-zero value, readline will enable the readline-6.2 signal handler\n    behavior in callback mode: handlers are installed when\n    rl_callback_handler_install is called and removed removed when a complete\n    line has been read.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-6.3, and the\nprevious version, readline-6.2.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Fixed a bug that did not allow the `dd', `cc', or `yy' vi editing mode\n    commands to work on the entire line.\n\nb.  Fixed a bug that caused redisplay problems with prompts longer than 128\n    characters and history searches.\n\nc.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to try and run code to modify its idea\n    of the screen size in a signal handler context upon receiving a SIGWINCH.\n\nd.  Fixed a bug that caused the `meta' key to be enabled beyond the duration\n    of an individual call top readline().\n    \ne.  Added a workaround for a wcwidth bug in Mac OS X that caused readline's\n    redisplay to mishandle zero-width combining characters.\n\nf.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to `forget' part of a key sequence when\n    a multiple-key sequence caused it to break out of an incremental search.\n\ng.  Fixed bugs that caused readline to execute code in a signal handler\n    context if interrupted while reading from the file system during completion.\n\nh.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to `forget' part of a key sequence when\n    reading an unbound multi-character key sequence.\n\ni.  Fixed a bug that caused Readline's signal handlers to be installed beyond\n    the bounds of a single call to readline().\n\nj.  Fixed a bug that caused the `.' command to not redo the most recent `R'\n    command in vi mode.\n\nk.  Fixed a bug that caused ignoring case in completion matches to result in\n    readline using the wrong match.\n\nl.  Paren matching now works in vi insert mode.\n\nm.  Fix menu-completion to make show-all-if-ambiguous and menu-complete-display-prefix\n    work together.\n\nn.  Fixed a bug that didn't allow the `cc', `dd', or `yy' commands to be redone\n    in vi editing mode.\n\no.  Fixed a bug that caused the filename comparison code to not compare\n    multibyte characters correctly when using case-sensitive or case-mapping\n    comparisons.\n\np.  Fixed the input reading loop to call the input hook function only when there\n    is no terminal input available.\n\nq.  Fixed a bug that caused binding a macro to a multi-character key sequence\n    where the sequence and macro value share a common prefix to not perform\n    the macro replacement.\n\nr.  Fixed several redisplay errors with multibyte characters and prompts\n    containing invisible characters when using horizontal scrolling.\n\ns.  Fixed a bug that caused redisplay errors when trying to overwrite\n    existing characters using multibyte characters.\n\nt.  Fixed a bug in vi mode that caused the arrow keys to set the saved last\n    vi-mode command to the wrong value.\n\nu.  Fixed a bug that caused double-quoted strings to be scanned incorrectly\n    when being used as the value of a readline variable assignment.\n\nv.  Fixed a bug with vi mode that prevented `.' from repeating a command\n    entered on a previous line (command).\n\nw.  Fixed a bug that could cause completion to core dump if it was interrupted\n    by a signal.\n\nx. Fixed a bug that could cause readline to crash and seg fault attempting to\n   expand an empty history entry.\n\ny. Fixed a bug that caused display problems with multi-line prompts containing\n   invisible characters on multiple lines.\n   \nz. Fixed a bug that caused effects made by undoing changes to a history line to\n   be discarded.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  Readline is now more responsive to SIGHUP and other fatal signals when\n    reading input from the terminal or performing word completion but no\n    longer attempts to run any not-allowable functions from a signal handler\n    context.\n\nb.  There are new bindable commands to search the history for the string of\n    characters between the beginning of the line and the point\n    (history-substring-search-forward, history-substring-search-backward)\n\nc.  Readline allows quoted strings as the values of variables when setting\n    them with `set'.  As a side effect, trailing spaces and tabs are ignored\n    when setting a string variable's value.\n\nd.  The history library creates a backup of the history file when writing it\n    and restores the backup on a write error.\n\ne.  New application-settable variable: rl_filename_stat_hook: a function called\n    with a filename before using it in a call to stat(2).  Bash uses it to\n    expand shell variables so things like $HOME/Downloads have a slash\n    appended.\n\nf.  New bindable function `print-last-kbd-macro', prints the most-recently-\n    defined keyboard macro in a reusable format.\n\ng.  New user-settable variable `colored-stats', enables use of colored text\n    to denote file types when displaying possible completions (colored analog\n    of visible-stats).\n\nh.  New user-settable variable `keyseq-timout', acts as an inter-character\n    timeout when reading input or incremental search strings.\n\ni.  New application-callable function: rl_clear_history. Clears the history list\n    and frees all readline-associated private data.\n\nj.  New user-settable variable, show-mode-in-prompt, adds a characters to the\n    beginning of the prompt indicating the current editing mode.\n\nk.  New application-settable variable: rl_input_available_hook; function to be\n    called when readline needs to check whether there is data available on its\n    input source.  The default hook checks rl_instream.\n\nl.  Readline calls an application-set event hook (rl_signal_event_hook) after\n    it gets a signal while reading input (read returns -1/EINTR but readline    \n    does not handle the signal immediately) to allow the application to handle\n    or otherwise note it.  Not currently called for SIGHUP or SIGTERM.\n    \nm.  If the user-settable variable `history-size' is set to a value less than\n    0, the history list size is unlimited.\n\nn.  When creating shared libraries on Mac OS X, the pathname written into the\n    library (install_name) no longer includes the minor version number.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-6.2,\nand the previous version, readline-6.1.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Fixed a bug that caused the unconverted filename to be added to the list of\n    completions when the application specified filename conversion functions.\n\nb.  Fixed a bug that caused the wrong filename to be passed to opendir when the\n    application has specified a filename dequoting function.\n\nc.  Fixed a bug when repeating a character search in vi mode in the case where\n    there was no search to repeat.\n\nd.  When show-all-if-ambiguous is set, the completion routines no longer insert\n    a common match prefix that is shorter than the text being completed.\n\ne.  The full set of vi editing commands may now be used in callback mode.\n\nf.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to not update its idea of the terminal\n    dimensions while running in `no-echo' mode.\n\nh.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to dump core if an application called\n    rl_prep_terminal without setting rl_instream.\n\ni.  Fixed a bug that caused meta-prefixed characters bound to incremental\n    search forward or backward to not be recognized if they were typed\n    subsequently.\n\nj.  The incremental search code treats key sequences that map to the same\n    functions as (default) ^G, ^W, and ^Y as equivalent to those characters.\n\nk.  Fixed a bug in menu-complete that caused it to misbehave with large\n    negative argument.\n\nl.  Fixed a bug that caused vi-mode yank-last-arg to ring the bell when invoked\n    at the end of the line.\n\nm.  Fixed a bug that made an explicit argument of 0 to yank-last-arg behave\n    as if it were a negative argument.\n\nn.  Fixed a bug that caused directory names in words to be completed to not\n    be dequoted correctly.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  The history library does not try to write the history filename in the\n    current directory if $HOME is unset.  This closes a potential security\n    problem if the application does not specify a history filename.\n\nb.  New bindable variable `completion-display-width' to set the number of\n    columns used when displaying completions.\n\nc.  New bindable variable `completion-case-map' to cause case-insensitive\n    completion to treat `-' and `_' as identical.\n\nd.  There are new bindable vi-mode command names to avoid readline's case-\n    insensitive matching not allowing them to be bound separately.\n\ne.  New bindable variable `menu-complete-display-prefix' causes the menu\n    completion code to display the common prefix of the possible completions\n    before cycling through the list, instead of after.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-6.1,\nand the previous version, readline-6.0.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  The SIGWINCH signal handler now avoids calling the redisplay code if\n    one arrives while in the middle of redisplay.\n\nb.  Changes to the timeout code to make sure that timeout values greater\n    than one second are handled better.\n\nc.  Fixed a bug in the redisplay code that was triggered by a prompt\n    containing invisible characters exactly the width of the screen.\n\nd.  Fixed a bug in the redisplay code encountered when running in horizontal\n    scroll mode.\n\ne.  Fixed a bug that prevented menu completion from properly completing\n    filenames.\n\nf.  Fixed a redisplay bug caused by a multibyte character causing a line to\n    wrap.\n\ng.  Fixed a bug that caused key sequences of two characters to not be\n    recognized when a longer sequence identical in the first two characters\n    was bound.\n\nh.  Fixed a bug that caused history expansion to be attempted on $'...'\n    single-quoted strings.\n\ni.  Fixed a bug that caused incorrect redisplay when the prompt contained\n    multibyte characters in an `invisible' sequence bracketed by \\[ and\n    \\].\n\nj.  Fixed a bug that caused history expansion to short-circuit after\n    encountering a multibyte character.\n\nk.  Fixed a bug that caused applications using the callback interface to not\n    react to SIGINT (or other signals) until another character arrived.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  New bindable function: menu-complete-backward.\n\nb.  In the vi insertion keymap, C-n is now bound to menu-complete by default,\n    and C-p to menu-complete-backward.\n\nc.  When in vi command mode, repeatedly hitting ESC now does nothing, even\n    when ESC introduces a bound key sequence.  This is closer to how\n    historical vi behaves.\n\nd.  New bindable function: skip-csi-sequence.  Can be used as a default to\n    consume key sequences generated by keys like Home and End without having\n    to bind all keys.\n\ne.  New application-settable function: rl_filename_rewrite_hook.  Can be used\n    to rewrite or modify filenames read from the file system before they are\n    compared to the word to be completed.\n\nf.  New bindable variable: skip-completed-text, active when completing in the\n    middle of a word.  If enabled, it means that characters in the completion\n    that match characters in the remainder of the word are \"skipped\" rather\n    than inserted into the line.\n\ng.  The pre-readline-6.0 version of menu completion is available as\n    \"old-menu-complete\" for users who do not like the readline-6.0 version.\n\nh.  New bindable variable: echo-control-characters.  If enabled, and the\n    tty ECHOCTL bit is set, controls the echoing of characters corresponding\n    to keyboard-generated signals.\n\ni.  New bindable variable: enable-meta-key.  Controls whether or not readline\n    sends the smm/rmm sequences if the terminal indicates it has a meta key\n    that enables eight-bit characters.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-6.0,\nand the previous version, readline-5.2.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Fixed a number of redisplay errors in environments supporting multibyte \n    characters.\n\nb.  Fixed bugs in vi command mode that caused motion commands to inappropriately\n    set the mark.\n\nc.  When using the arrow keys in vi insertion mode, readline allows movement\n    beyond the current end of the line (unlike command mode).\n\nd.  Fixed bugs that caused readline to loop when the terminal has been taken\n    away and reads return -1/EIO.\n\ne.  Fixed bugs in redisplay occurring when displaying prompts containing\n    invisible characters.\n\nf.  Fixed a bug that caused the completion append character to not be reset to\n    the default after an application-specified completion function changed it.\n\ng.  Fixed a problem that caused incorrect positioning of the cursor while in\n    emacs editing mode when moving forward at the end of a line while using\n    a locale supporting multibyte characters.\n\nh.  Fixed an off-by-one error that caused readline to drop every 511th\n    character of buffered input.\n\ni.  Fixed a bug that resulted in SIGTERM not being caught or cleaned up.\n\nj.  Fixed redisplay bugs caused by multiline prompts with invisible characters\n    or no characters following the final newline.\n\nk.  Fixed redisplay bug caused by prompts consisting solely of invisible\n    characters.\n\nl.  Fixed a bug in the code that buffers characters received very quickly in\n    succession which caused characters to be dropped.\n\nm.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to reference uninitialized data structures\n    if it received a SIGWINCH before completing initialization.\n\nn.  Fixed a bug that caused the vi-mode `last command' to be set incorrectly\n    and therefore unrepeatable.\n\no.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to disable echoing when it was being used\n    with an output file descriptor that was not a terminal.\n\np.  Readline now blocks SIGINT while manipulating internal data structures\n    during redisplay.\n\nq.  Fixed a bug in redisplay that caused readline to segfault when pasting a\n    very long line (over 130,000 characters).\n\nr.  Fixed bugs in redisplay when using prompts with no visible printing\n    characters.\n\ns.  Fixed a bug that caused redisplay errors when using prompts with invisible\n    characters and numeric arguments to a command in a multibyte locale.\n\nt.  Fixed a bug that caused redisplay errors when using prompts with invisible\n    characters spanning more than two physical screen lines.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  A new variable, rl_sort_completion_matches; allows applications to inhibit\n    match list sorting (but beware: some things don't work right if\n    applications do this).\n\nb.  A new variable, rl_completion_invoking_key; allows applications to discover\n    the key that invoked rl_complete or rl_menu_complete.\n\nc.  The functions rl_block_sigint and rl_release_sigint are now public and\n    available to calling applications who want to protect critical sections\n    (like redisplay).\n\nd.  The functions rl_save_state and rl_restore_state are now public and\n    available to calling applications; documented rest of readline's state\n    flag values.\n\ne.  A new user-settable variable, `history-size', allows setting the maximum\n    number of entries in the history list.\n\nf.  There is a new implementation of menu completion, with several improvements\n    over the old; the most notable improvement is a better `completions\n    browsing' mode.\n\ng.  The menu completion code now uses the rl_menu_completion_entry_function\n    variable, allowing applications to provide their own menu completion\n    generators.\n\nh.  There is support for replacing a prefix  of a pathname with a `...' when\n    displaying possible completions.  This is controllable by setting the\n    `completion-prefix-display-length' variable.  Matches with a common prefix\n    longer than this value have the common prefix replaced with `...'.\n\ni.  There is a new `revert-all-at-newline' variable.  If enabled, readline will\n    undo all outstanding changes to all history lines when `accept-line' is\n    executed.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-5.2,\nand the previous version, readline-5.1.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Fixed a problem that caused segmentation faults when using readline in\n    callback mode and typing consecutive DEL characters on an empty line.\n\nb.  Fixed several redisplay problems with multibyte characters, all having to\n    do with the different code paths and variable meanings between single-byte\n    and multibyte character redisplay.\n\nc.  Fixed a problem with key sequence translation when presented with the\n    sequence \\M-\\C-x.\n\nd.  Fixed a problem that prevented the `a' command in vi mode from being\n    undone and redone properly.\n\ne.  Fixed a problem that prevented empty inserts in vi mode from being undone\n    properly.\n\nf.  Fixed a problem that caused readline to initialize with an incorrect idea\n    of whether or not the terminal can autowrap.\n\ng.  Fixed output of key bindings (like bash `bind -p') to honor the setting of\n    convert-meta and use \\e where appropriate.\n\nh.  Changed the default filename completion function to call the filename\n    dequoting function if the directory completion hook isn't set.  This means\n    that any directory completion hooks need to dequote the directory name,\n    since application-specific hooks need to know how the word was quoted,\n    even if no other changes are made.\n\ni.  Fixed a bug with creating the prompt for a non-interactive search string\n    when there are non-printing characters in the primary prompt.\n\nj.  Fixed a bug that caused prompts with invisible characters to be redrawn\n    multiple times in a multibyte locale.\n\nk.  Fixed a bug that could cause the key sequence scanning code to return the\n    wrong function.\n\nl.  Fixed a problem with the callback interface that caused it to fail when\n    using multi-character keyboard macros.\n\nm.  Fixed a bug that could cause a core dump when an edited history entry was\n    re-executed under certain conditions.\n\nn.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to reference freed memory when attmpting\n    to display a portion of the prompt.\n\no.  Fixed a bug with prompt redisplay in a multi-byte locale to avoid redrawing\n    the prompt and input line multiple times.\n\np.  Fixed history expansion to not be confused by here-string redirection.\n\nq.  Readline no longer treats read errors by converting them to newlines, as\n    it does with EOF.  This caused partial lines to be returned from readline().\n\nr.  Fixed a redisplay bug that occurred in multibyte-capable locales when the\n    prompt was one character longer than the screen width.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  Calling applications can now set the keyboard timeout to 0, allowing\n    poll-like behavior.\n\nb.  The value of SYS_INPUTRC (configurable at compilation time) is now used as\n    the default last-ditch startup file.\n\nc.  The history file reading functions now allow windows-like \\r\\n line\n    terminators.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-5.1,\nand the previous version, readline-5.0.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Fixed a bug that caused multiliine prompts to be wrapped and displayed\n    incorrectly.\n\nb.  Fixed a bug that caused ^P/^N in emacs mode to fail to display the current\n    line correctly.\n\nc.  Fixed a problem in computing the number of invisible characters on the first\n    line of a prompt whose length exceeds the screen width.\n\nd.  Fixed vi-mode searching so that failure preserves the current line rather\n    than the last line in the history list.\n\ne.  Fixed the vi-mode `~' command (change-case) to have the correct behavior at\n    end-of-line when manipulating multibyte characters.\n\nf.  Fixed the vi-mode `r' command (change-char) to have the correct behavior at\n    end-of-line when manipulating multibyte characters.\n\ng.  Fixed multiple bugs in the redisplay of multibyte characters:  displaying\n    prompts longer than the screen width containing multibyte characters,\n\nh.  Fix the calculation of the number of physical characters in the prompt\n    string when it contains multibyte characters.\n\ni.  A non-zero value for the `rl_complete_suppress_append' variable now causes\n    no `/' to be appended to a directory name.\n\nj.  Fixed forward-word and backward-word to work when words contained\n    multibyte characters.\n\nk.  Fixed a bug in finding the delimiter of a `?' substring when performing\n    history expansion in a locale that supports multibyte characters.\n\nl.  Fixed a memory leak caused by not freeing the timestamp in a history entry.\n\nm.  Fixed a bug that caused \"\\M-x\" style key bindings to not obey the setting\n    of the `convert-meta' variable.\n\nn.  Fixed saving and restoring primary prompt when prompting for incremental   \n    and non-incremental searches; search prompts now display multibyte\n    characters correctly.\n\no.  Fixed a bug that caused keys originally bound to self-insert but shadowed\n    by a multi-character key sequence to not be inserted.\n\np.  Fixed code so rl_prep_term_function and rl_deprep_term_function aren't\n    dereferenced if NULL (matching the documentation).\n\nq.  Extensive changes to readline to add enough state so that commands\n    requiring additional characters (searches, multi-key sequences, numeric\n    arguments, commands requiring an additional specifier character like\n    vi-mode change-char, etc.) work without synchronously waiting for\n    additional input.\n\nr.  Lots of changes so readline builds and runs on MinGW.\n\ns.  Readline no longer tries to modify the terminal settings when running in\n    callback mode.\n\nt.  The Readline display code no longer sets the location of the last invisible\n    character in the prompt if the \\[\\] sequence is empty.\n\nu.  The `change-case' command now correctly changes the case of multibyte\n    characters.\n\nv.  Changes to the shared library construction scripts to deal with Windows\n    DLL naming conventions for Cygwin.\n\nw.  Fixed the redisplay code to avoid core dumps resulting from a poorly-timed\n    SIGWINCH.\n\nx.  Fixed the non-incremental search code in vi mode to dispose of any current\n    undo list when copying a line from the history into the current editing\n    buffer.\n\ny.  Fixed a bug that caused reversing the incremental search direction to\n    not work correctly.  \n    \nz.  Fixed the vi-mode `U' command to only undo up to the first time insert mode\n    was entered, as Posix specifies.\n\naa. Fixed a bug in the vi-mode `r' command that left the cursor in the wrong\n    place.\n\nbb. Fixed a redisplay bug caused by moving the cursor vertically to a line\n    with invisible characters in the prompt in a multibyte locale.\n\ncc. Fixed a bug that could cause the terminal special chars to be bound in the\n    wrong keymap in vi mode.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  The key sequence sent by the keypad `delete' key is now automatically   \n    bound to delete-char.\n\nb.  A negative argument to menu-complete now cycles backward through the\n    completion list.\n\nc.  A new bindable readline variable:  bind-tty-special-chars.  If non-zero,\n    readline will bind the terminal special characters to their readline\n    equivalents when it's called (on by default).\n\nd.  New bindable command: vi-rubout.  Saves deleted text for possible  \n    reinsertion, as with any vi-mode `text modification' command; `X' is bound\n    to this in vi command mode.\n\ne.  If the rl_completion_query_items is set to a value < 0, readline never\n    asks the user whether or not to view the possible completions.\n\nf.  The `C-w' binding in incremental search now understands multibyte\n    characters.\n\ng.  New application-callable auxiliary function, rl_variable_value, returns \n    a string corresponding to a readline variable's value.\n\nh.  When parsing inputrc files and variable binding commands, the parser\n    strips trailing whitespace from values assigned to boolean variables\n    before checking them.\n\ni.  A new external application-controllable variable that allows the LINES   \n    and COLUMNS environment variables to set the window size regardless of\n    what the kernel returns.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-5.0,\nand the previous version, readline-4.3.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Fixes to avoid core dumps because of null pointer references in the\n    multibyte character code.\n\nb.  Fix to avoid infinite recursion caused by certain key combinations.\n\nc.  Fixed a bug that caused the vi-mode `last command' to be set incorrectly.\n\nd.  Readline no longer tries to read ahead more than one line of input, even\n    when more is available.\n\ne.  Fixed the code that adjusts the point to not mishandle null wide\n    characters.\n\nf.  Fixed a bug in the history expansion `g' modifier that caused it to skip\n    every other match.\n\ng.  Fixed a bug that caused the prompt to overwrite previous output when the\n    output doesn't contain a newline and the locale supports multibyte\n    characters.  This same change fixes the problem of readline redisplay\n    slowing down dramatically as the line gets longer in multibyte locales.\n\nh.  History traversal with arrow keys in vi insertion mode causes the cursor\n    to be placed at the end of the new line, like in emacs mode.\n\ni.  The locale initialization code does a better job of using the right\n    precedence and defaulting when checking the appropriate environment\n    variables.\n\nj.  Fixed the history word tokenizer to handle <( and >( better when used as\n    part of bash.\n\nk.  The overwrite mode code received several bug fixes to improve undo.\n\nl.  Many speedups to the multibyte character redisplay code.\n\nm.  The callback character reading interface should not hang waiting to read\n    keyboard input.\n\nn.  Fixed a bug with redoing vi-mode `s' command.\n\no.  The code that initializes the terminal tracks changes made to the terminal\n    special characters with stty(1) (or equivalent), so that these changes\n    are reflected in the readline bindings.  New application-callable function\n    to make it work:  rl_tty_unset_default_bindings().\n\np.  Fixed a bug that could cause garbage to be inserted in the buffer when\n    changing character case in vi mode when using a multibyte locale.\n\nq.  Fixed a bug in the redisplay code that caused problems on systems\n    supporting multibyte characters when moving between history lines when the\n    new line has more glyphs but fewer bytes.\n\nr.  Undo and redo now work better after exiting vi insertion mode.\n\ns.  Make sure system calls are restarted after a SIGWINCH is received using\n    SA_RESTART.\n\nt.  Improvements to the code that displays possible completions when using\n    multibyte characters.\n\nu.  Fixed a problem when parsing nested if statements in inputrc files.\n\nv.  The completer now takes multibyte characters into account when looking for\n    quoted substrings on which to perform completion.\n\nw.  The history search functions now perform better bounds checking on the\n    history list.\n\nx.  Change to history expansion functions to treat `^' as equivalent to word \n    one, as the documentation states.\n\ny.  Some changes to the display code to improve display and redisplay of\n    multibyte characters.\n\nz.  Changes to speed up the multibyte character redisplay code.\n\naa. Fixed a bug in the vi-mode `E' command that caused it to skip over the\n    last character of a word if invoked while point was on the word's\n    next-to-last character.\n\nbb. Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect filename quoting when\n    case-insensitive completion was enabled and the word being completed\n    contained backslashes quoting word break characters.\n\ncc. Fixed a bug in redisplay triggered when the prompt string contains\n    invisible characters.\n\ndd. Fixed some display (and other) bugs encountered in multibyte locales\n    when a non-ascii character was the last character on a line.\n\nee. Fixed some display bugs caused by multibyte characters in prompt strings.\n\nff. Fixed a problem with history expansion caused by non-whitespace characters\n    used as history word delimiters.\n\ngg. Fixed a problem that could cause readline to refer to freed memory when\n    moving between history lines while doing searches.\n\nhh. Improvements to the code that expands and displays prompt strings\n    containing multibyte characters.\n\nii. Fixed a problem with vi-mode not correctly remembering the numeric argument\n    to the last `c'hange command for later use with `.'.\n\njj. Fixed a bug in vi-mode that caused multi-digit count arguments to work   \n    incorrectly.\n\nkk. Fixed a problem in vi-mode that caused the last text modification command\n    to not be remembered across different command lines.\n\nll. Fixed problems with changing characters and changing case at the end of\n    the line.\n\nmm. Fixed a problem with readline saving the contents of the current line\n    before beginning a non-interactive search.\n\nnn. Fixed a problem with EOF detection when using rl_event_hook.\n\noo. Fixed a problem with the vi mode `p' and `P' commands ignoring numeric\n    arguments.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  History expansion has a new `a' modifier equivalent to the `g' modifier\n    for compatibility with the BSD csh.\n\nb.  History expansion has a new `G' modifier equivalent to the BSD csh `g'\n    modifier, which performs a substitution once per word.\n\nc.  All non-incremental search operations may now undo the operation of\n    replacing the current line with the history line.\n\nd.  The text inserted by an `a' command in vi mode can be reinserted with\n    `.'.\n\ne.  New bindable variable, `show-all-if-unmodified'.  If set, the readline\n    completer will list possible completions immediately if there is more\n    than one completion and partial completion cannot be performed.\n\nf.  There is a new application-callable `free_history_entry()' function.\n\ng.  History list entries now contain timestamp information; the history file\n    functions know how to read and write timestamp information associated\n    with each entry.\n\nh.  Four new key binding functions have been added:\n\n\trl_bind_key_if_unbound()\n\trl_bind_key_if_unbound_in_map()\n\trl_bind_keyseq_if_unbound()\n\trl_bind_keyseq_if_unbound_in_map()\n\ni.  New application variable, rl_completion_quote_character, set to any\n    quote character readline finds before it calls the application completion\n    function.\n\nj.  New application variable, rl_completion_suppress_quote, settable by an   \n    application completion function.  If set to non-zero, readline does not\n    attempt to append a closing quote to a completed word.\n    \nk.  New application variable, rl_completion_found_quote, set to a non-zero\n    value if readline determines that the word to be completed is quoted.\n    Set before readline calls any application completion function.\n\nl.  New function hook, rl_completion_word_break_hook, called when readline\n    needs to break a line into words when completion is attempted.  Allows\n    the word break characters to vary based on position in the line.\n\nm.  New bindable command: unix-filename-rubout.  Does the same thing as\n    unix-word-rubout, but adds `/' to the set of word delimiters.\n\nn.  When listing completions, directories have a `/' appended if the\n    `mark-directories' option has been enabled.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-4.3,\nand the previous version, readline-4.2a.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Fixed output of comment-begin character when listing variable values.\n\nb.  Added some default key bindings for common escape sequences produced by\n    HOME and END keys.\n\nc.  Fixed the mark handling code to be more emacs-compatible.\n\nd.  A bug was fixed in the code that prints possible completions to keep it\n    from printing empty strings in certain circumstances.\n\ne.  Change the key sequence printing code to print ESC as M\\- if ESC is a\n    meta-prefix character -- it's easier for users to understand than \\e.\n\nf.  Fixed unstifle_history() to return values that match the documentation.\n\ng.  Fixed the event loop (rl_event_hook) to handle the case where the input\n    file descriptor is invalidated.\n\nh.  Fixed the prompt display code to work better when the application has a\n    custom redisplay function.\n\ni.  Changes to make reading and writing the history file a little faster, and\n    to cope with huge history files without calling abort(3) from xmalloc.\n\nj.  The vi-mode `S' and `s' commands are now undone correctly.\n\nk.  Fixed a problem which caused the display to be messed up when the last\n    line of a multi-line prompt (possibly containing invisible characters)\n    was longer than the screen width.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  Support for key `subsequences':  allows, e.g., ESC and ESC-a to both\n    be bound to readline functions.  Now the arrow keys may be used in vi\n    insert mode.\n\nb.  When listing completions, and the number of lines displayed is more than\n    the screen length, readline uses an internal pager to display the results.\n    This is controlled by the `page-completions' variable (default on).\n\nc.  New code to handle editing and displaying multibyte characters.\n\nd.  The behavior introduced in bash-2.05a of deciding whether or not to\n    append a slash to a completed name that is a symlink to a directory has\n    been made optional, controlled by the `mark-symlinked-directories'\n    variable (default is the 2.05a behavior).\n\ne.  The `insert-comment' command now acts as a toggle if given a numeric\n    argument:  if the first characters on the line don't specify a\n    comment, insert one; if they do, delete the comment text\n\nf.  New application-settable completion variable:\n    rl_completion_mark_symlink_dirs, allows an application's completion\n    function to temporarily override the user's preference for appending\n    slashes to names which are symlinks to directories.\n\ng.  New function available to application completion functions:\n    rl_completion_mode, to tell how the completion function was invoked\n    and decide which argument to supply to rl_complete_internal (to list\n    completions, etc.).\n\nh.  Readline now has an overwrite mode, toggled by the `overwrite-mode'\n    bindable command, which could be bound to `Insert'.\n\ni.  New application-settable completion variable:\n    rl_completion_suppress_append, inhibits appending of\n    rl_completion_append_character to completed words.\n\nj.  New key bindings when reading an incremental search string:  ^W yanks\n    the currently-matched word out of the current line into the search\n    string; ^Y yanks the rest of the current line into the search string,\n    DEL or ^H deletes characters from the search string.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-4.2a,\nand the previous version, readline-4.2.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  More `const' and type casting fixes.\n\nb.  Changed rl_message() to use vsnprintf(3) (if available) to fix buffer\n    overflow problems.\n\nc.  The completion code no longer appends a `/' or ` ' to a match when\n    completing a symbolic link that resolves to a directory name, unless\n    the match does not add anything to the word being completed.  This\n    means that a tab will complete the word up to the full name, but not\n    add anything, and a subsequent tab will add a slash.\n\nd.  Fixed a trivial typo that made the vi-mode `dT' command not work.\n\ne.  Fixed the tty code so that ^S and ^Q can be inserted with rl_quoted_insert.\n\nf.  Fixed the tty code so that ^V works more than once.\n\ng.  Changed the use of __P((...)) for function prototypes to PARAMS((...))\n    because the use of __P in typedefs conflicted g++ and glibc.\n\nh.  The completion code now attempts to do a better job of preserving the\n    case of the word the user typed if ignoring case in completions.\n\ni.  Readline defaults to not echoing the input and lets the terminal\n    initialization code enable echoing if there is a controlling terminal.\n\nj.  The key binding code now processes only two hex digits after a `\\x'\n    escape sequence, and the documentation was changed to note that the\n    octal and hex escape sequences result in an eight-bit value rather\n    than strict ASCII.\n\nk.  Fixed a few places where negative array subscripts could have occurred.\n    \nl.  Fixed the vi-mode code to use a better method to determine the bounds of\n    the array used to hold the marks, and to avoid out-of-bounds references.\n    \nm.  Fixed the defines in chardefs.h to work better when chars are signed.\n    \nn.  Fixed configure.in to use the new names for bash autoconf macros.\n    \no.  Readline no longer attempts to define its own versions of some ctype\n    macros if they are implemented as functions in libc but not as macros in\n    <ctype.h>.\n\np.  Fixed a problem where rl_backward could possibly set point to before\n    the beginning of the line.\n\nq.  Fixed Makefile to not put -I/usr/include into CFLAGS, since it can cause\n    include file problems.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  Added extern declaration for rl_get_termcap to readline.h, making it a\n    public function (it was always there, just not in readline.h).\n\nb.  New #defines in readline.h:  RL_READLINE_VERSION, currently 0x0402,\n    RL_VERSION_MAJOR, currently 4, and RL_VERSION_MINOR, currently 2.\n\nc.  New readline variable:  rl_readline_version, mirrors RL_READLINE_VERSION.\n\nd.  New bindable boolean readline variable:  match-hidden-files.  Controls\n    completion of files beginning with a `.' (on Unix).  Enabled by default.\n\ne.  The history expansion code now allows any character to terminate a\n    `:first-' modifier, like csh.\n\nf.  The incremental search code remembers the last search string and uses\n    it if ^R^R is typed without a search string.\n\nh.  New bindable variable `history-preserve-point'.  If set, the history\n    code attempts to place the user at the same location on each history\n    line retrieved with previous-history or next-history.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-4.2,\nand the previous version, readline-4.1.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  When setting the terminal attributes on systems using `struct termio',\n    readline waits for output to drain before changing the attributes.\n\nb.  A fix was made to the history word tokenization code to avoid attempts to\n    dereference a null pointer.\n\nc.  Readline now defaults rl_terminal_name to $TERM if the calling application\n    has left it unset, and tries to initialize with the resultant value.\n\nd.  Instead of calling (*rl_getc_function)() directly to get input in certain\n    places, readline now calls rl_read_key() consistently.\n\ne.  Fixed a bug in the completion code that allowed a backslash to quote a\n    single quote inside a single-quoted string.\n\nf.  rl_prompt is no longer assigned directly from the argument to readline(),\n    but uses memory allocated by readline.  This allows constant strings to\n    be passed to readline without problems arising when the prompt processing\n    code wants to modify the string.\n\ng.  Fixed a bug that caused non-interactive history searches to return the\n    wrong line when performing multiple searches backward for the same string.\n\nh.  Many variables, function arguments, and function return values are now\n    declared `const' where appropriate, to improve behavior when linking with\n    C++ code.\n\ni.  The control character detection code now works better on systems where\n    `char' is unsigned by default.\n\nj.  The vi-mode numeric argument is now capped at 999999, just like emacs mode.\n\nk.  The Function, CPFunction, CPPFunction, and VFunction typedefs have been\n    replaced with a set of specific prototyped typedefs, though they are\n    still in the readline header files for backwards compatibility.\n\nm.  Nearly all of the (undocumented) internal global variables in the library\n    now have an _rl_ prefix -- there were a number that did not, like\n    screenheight, screenwidth, alphabetic, etc.\n\nn.  The ding() convenience function has been renamed to rl_ding(), though the\n    old function is still defined for backwards compatibility.\n\no.  The completion convenience functions filename_completion_function,\n    username_completion_function, and completion_matches now have an rl_\n    prefix, though the old names are still defined for backwards compatibility.\n\np.  The functions shared by readline and bash (linkage is satisfied from bash\n    when compiling with bash, and internally otherwise) now have an sh_ prefix.\n\nq.  Changed the shared library creation procedure on Linux and BSD/OS 4.x so\n    that the `soname' contains only the major version number rather than the\n    major and minor numbers.\n\nr.  Fixed a redisplay bug that occurred when the prompt spanned more than one\n    physical line and contained invisible characters.\n\ns.  Added a missing `includedir' variable to the Makefile.\n\nt.  When installing the shared libraries, make sure symbolic links are relative.\n\nu.  Added configure test so that it can set `${MAKE}' appropriately.\n\nv.  Fixed a bug in rl_forward that could cause the point to be set to before\n    the beginning of the line in vi mode.\n\nw.  Fixed a bug in the callback read-char interface to make it work when a\n    readline function pushes some input onto the input stream with\n    rl_execute_next (like the incremental search functions).\n\nx.  Fixed a file descriptor leak in the history file manipulation code that\n    was tripped when attempting to truncate a non-regular file (like\n    /dev/null).\n\ny.  Changes to make all of the exported readline functions declared in\n    readline.h have an rl_ prefix (rltty_set_default_bindings is now\n    rl_tty_set_default_bindings, crlf is now rl_crlf, etc.)\n\nz.  The formatted documentation included in the base readline distribution\n    is no longer removed on a `make distclean'.\n\naa. Some changes were made to avoid gcc warnings with -Wall.\n\nbb. rl_get_keymap_by_name now finds keymaps case-insensitively, so\n    `set keymap EMACS' works.\n\ncc. The history file writing and truncation functions now return a useful\n    status on error.\n\ndd. Fixed a bug that could cause applications to dereference a NULL pointer\n    if a NULL second argument was passed to history_expand().\n\nee. If a hook function assigned to rl_event_hook sets rl_done to a non-zero\n    value, rl_read_key() now immediately returns '\\n' (which is assumed to   \n    be bound to accept-line).\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  The blink timeout for paren matching is now settable by applications,\n    via the rl_set_paren_blink_timeout() function.\n\nb.  _rl_executing_macro has been renamed to rl_executing_macro, which means\n    it's now part of the public interface.\n\nc.  Readline has a new variable, rl_readline_state, which is a bitmap that\n    encapsulates the current state of the library; intended for use by\n    callbacks and hook functions.\n\nd.  rlfe has a new -l option to log input and output (-a appends to logfile),\n    a new -n option to set the readline application name, and -v and -h\n    options for version and help information.\n\ne.  rlfe can now perform filename completion for the inferior process if the\n    OS has a /proc/<PID>/cwd that can be read with readlink(2) to get the\n    inferior's current working directory.\n\nf.  A new file, rltypedefs.h, contains the new typedefs for function pointers\n    and is installed by `make install'.\n\ng.  New application-callable function rl_set_prompt(const char *prompt):\n    expands its prompt string argument and sets rl_prompt to the result.\n\nh.  New application-callable function rl_set_screen_size(int rows, int cols):\n    public method for applications to set readline's idea of the screen\n    dimensions.\n\ni.  The history example program (examples/histexamp.c) is now built as one\n    of the examples.\n\nj.  The documentation has been updated to cover nearly all of the public\n    functions and variables declared in readline.h.\n\nk.  New function, rl_get_screen_size (int *rows, int *columns), returns\n    readline's idea of the screen dimensions.\n\nl.  The timeout in rl_gather_tyi (readline keyboard input polling function)\n    is now settable via a function (rl_set_keyboard_input_timeout()).\n\nm.  Renamed the max_input_history variable to history_max_entries; the old\n    variable is maintained for backwards compatibility.\n\nn.  The list of characters that separate words for the history tokenizer is\n    now settable with a variable:  history_word_delimiters.  The default\n    value is as before.\n\no.  There is a new history.3 manual page documenting the history library.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-4.1,\nand the previous version, readline-4.0.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Changed the HTML documents so that the table-of-contents is no longer\n    a separate file.\n\nb.  Changes to the shared object configuration for: Irix 5.x, Irix 6.x,\n    OSF/1.\n\nc.  The shared library major and minor versions are now constructed\n    automatically by configure and substituted into the makefiles.\n\nd.  It's now possible to install the shared libraries separately from the\n    static libraries.\n\ne.  The history library tries to truncate the history file only if it is a\n    regular file.\n\nf.  A bug that caused _rl_dispatch to address negative array indices on\n    systems with signed chars was fixed.\n\ng.  rl-yank-nth-arg now leaves the history position the same as when it was\n    called.\n\nh.  Changes to the completion code to handle MS-DOS drive-letter:pathname\n    filenames.\n\ni.  Completion is now case-insensitive by default on MS-DOS.\n\nj.  Fixes to the history file manipulation code for MS-DOS.\n\nk.  Readline attempts to bind the arrow keys to appropriate defaults on MS-DOS.\n\nl.  Some fixes were made to the redisplay code for better operation on MS-DOS.\n\nm.  The quoted-insert code will now insert tty special chars like ^C.\n\nn.  A bug was fixed that caused the display code to reference memory before\n    the start of the prompt string.\n\no.  More support for __EMX__ (OS/2).\n\np.  A bug was fixed in readline's signal handling that could cause infinite\n    recursion in signal handlers.\n\nq.  A bug was fixed that caused the point to be less than zero when rl_forward\n    was given a very large numeric argument.\n\nr.  The vi-mode code now gets characters via the application-settable value\n    of rl_getc_function rather than calling rl_getc directly.\n\ns.  The history file code now uses O_BINARY mode when reading and writing\n    the history file on cygwin32.\n\nt.  Fixed a bug in the redisplay code for lines with more than 256 line\n    breaks.\n\nu.  A bug was fixed which caused invisible character markers to not be\n    stripped from the prompt string if the terminal was in no-echo mode.\n    \nv.  Readline no longer tries to get the variables it needs for redisplay \n    from the termcap entry if the calling application has specified its\n    own redisplay function.  Readline treats the terminal as `dumb' in\n    this case.\n\nw.  Fixes to the SIGWINCH code so that a multiple-line prompt with escape\n    sequences is redrawn correctly.\n\nx.  Changes to the install and install-shared targets so that the libraries\n    and header files are installed separately.\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  A new Readline `user manual' is in doc/rluserman.texinfo.\n\nb.  Parentheses matching is now always compiled into readline, and enabled\n    or disabled when the value of the `blink-matching-paren' variable is\n    changed.\n\nc.  MS-DOS systems now use ~/_inputrc as the last-ditch inputrc filename.\n\nd.  MS-DOS systems now use ~/_history as the default history file.\n\ne.  history-search-{forward,backward} now leave the point at the end of the\n    line when the string to search for is empty, like\n    {reverse,forward}-search-history.\n\nf.  history-search-{forward,backward} now leave the last history line found\n    in the readline buffer if the second or subsequent search fails.\n\ng.  New function for use by applications:  rl_on_new_line_with_prompt, used\n    when an application displays the prompt itself before calling readline().\n\nh.  New variable for use by applications:  rl_already_prompted.  An application\n    that displays the prompt itself before calling readline() must set this to\n    a non-zero value.\n\ni.  A new variable, rl_gnu_readline_p, always 1.  The intent is that an\n    application can verify whether or not it is linked with the `real'\n    readline library or some substitute.\n\nj.  Per Bothner's `rlfe' (pronounced `Ralphie') readline front-end program\n    is included in the examples subdirectory, though it is not built\n    by default.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-4.0,\nand the previous version, readline-2.2.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  The version number is now 4.0, to match the major and minor version\n    numbers on the shared readline and history libraries.  Future\n    releases will maintain the identical numbering.\n\nb.  Fixed a typo in the `make install' recipe that copied libreadline.a\n    to libhistory.old right after installing it.\n\nc.  The readline and history info files are now installed out of the source\n    directory if they are not found in the build directory.\n\nd.  The library no longer exports a function named `savestring' -- backwards\n    compatibility be damned.\n\ne.  There is no longer any #ifdef SHELL code in the source files.\n\nf.  Some changes were made to the key binding code to fix memory leaks and\n    better support Win32 systems.\n\ng.  Fixed a silly typo in the paren matching code -- it's microseconds, not\n    milliseconds.\n\nh.  The readline library should be compilable by C++ compilers.\n\ni.  The readline.h public header file now includes function prototypes for\n    all readline functions, and some changes were made to fix errors in the\n    source files uncovered by the use of prototypes.\n\nj.  The maximum numeric argument is now clamped at 1000000.\n\nk.  Fixes to rl_yank_last_arg to make it behave better.\n\nl.  Fixed a bug in the display code that caused core dumps if the prompt\n    string length exceeded 1024 characters.\n\nm.  The menu completion code was fixed to properly insert a single completion\n    if there is only one match.\n\nn.  A bug was fixed that caused the display code to improperly display tabs\n    after newlines.\n\no.  A fix was made to the completion code in which a typo caused the wrong\n    value to be passed to the function that computed the longest common\n    prefix of the list of matches.\n\np.  The completion code now checks the value of rl_filename_completion_desired,\n    which is set by application-supplied completion functions to indicate\n    that filename completion is being performed, to decide whether or not to\n    call an application-supplied `ignore completions' function.\n\nq.  Code was added to the history library to catch history substitutions\n    using `&' without a previous history substitution or search having been\n    performed.\n\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  There is a new script, support/shobj-conf, to do system-specific shared\n    object and library configuration.  It generates variables for configure\n    to substitute into makefiles.  The README file provides a detailed\n    explanation of the shared library creation process.\n\nb.  Shared libraries and objects are now built in the `shlib' subdirectory.\n    There is a shlib/Makefile.in to control the build process.  `make shared'\n    from the top-level directory is still the right way to build shared\n    versions of the libraries.\n\nc.  rlconf.h is now installed, so applications can find out which features\n    have been compiled into the installed readline and history libraries.\n\nd.  rlstdc.h is now an installed header file.\n\ne.  Many changes to the signal handling:\n        o Readline now catches SIGQUIT and cleans up the tty before returning;\n        o A new variable, rl_catch_signals, is available to application writers \n          to indicate to readline whether or not it should install its own\n          signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGALRM, SIGTSTP,\n          SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU;\n        o A new variable, rl_catch_sigwinch, is available to application\n          writers to indicate to readline whether or not it should install its\n          own signal handler for SIGWINCH, which will chain to the calling\n          applications's SIGWINCH handler, if one is installed;\n        o There is a new function, rl_free_line_state, for application signal\n          handlers to call to free up the state associated with the current\n          line after receiving a signal;\n        o There is a new function, rl_cleanup_after_signal, to clean up the\n          display and terminal state after receiving a signal;\n        o There is a new function, rl_reset_after_signal, to reinitialize the\n          terminal and display state after an application signal handler\n          returns and readline continues\n\nf.  There is a new function, rl_resize_terminal, to reset readline's idea of\n    the screen size after a SIGWINCH.\n\ng.  New public functions: rl_save_prompt and rl_restore_prompt.  These were\n    previously private functions with a `_' prefix.  These functions are\n    used when an application wants to write a message to the `message area'\n    with rl_message and have the prompt restored correctly when the message\n    is erased.\n\nh.  New function hook: rl_pre_input_hook, called just before readline starts\n    reading input, after initialization.\n\ni.  New function hook: rl_display_matches_hook, called when readline would\n    display the list of completion matches.  The new function\n    rl_display_match_list is what readline uses internally, and is available\n    for use by application functions called via this hook.\n\nj.  New bindable function, delete-char-or-list, like tcsh.\n\nk.  A new variable, rl_erase_empty_line, which, if set by an application using\n    readline, will cause readline to erase, prompt and all, lines on which the\n    only thing typed was a newline.\n\nl.  There is a new script, support/shlib-install, to install and uninstall\n    the shared readline and history libraries.\n\nm.  A new bindable variable, `isearch-terminators', which is a string\n    containing the set of characters that should terminate an incremental\n    search without being executed as a command.\n\nn.  A new bindable function, forward-backward-delete-char.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis document details the changes between this version, readline-2.2,\nand the previous version, readline-2.1.\n\n1.  Changes to Readline\n\na.  Added a missing `extern' to a declaration in readline.h that kept\n    readline from compiling cleanly on some systems.\n\nb.  The history file is now opened with mode 0600 when it is written for\n    better security.\n\nc.  Changes were made to the SIGWINCH handling code so that prompt redisplay\n    is done better.\n\nd.  ^G now interrupts incremental searches correctly.\n\ne.  A bug that caused a core dump when the set of characters to be quoted\n    when completing words was empty was fixed.\n\nf.  Fixed a problem in the readline test program rltest.c that caused a core\n    dump.\n\ng.  The code that handles parser directives in inputrc files now displays\n    more error messages.\n\nh.  The history expansion code was fixed so that the appearance of the\n    history comment character at the beginning of a word inhibits history\n    expansion for that word and the rest of the input line.\n\ni.  The code that prints completion listings now behaves better if one or\n    more of the filenames contains non-printable characters.\n\nj.  The time delay when showing matching parentheses is now 0.5 seconds.\n\n\n2.  New Features in Readline\n\na.  There is now an option for `iterative' yank-last-arg handline, so a user\n    can keep entering `M-.', yanking the last argument of successive history\n    lines.\n\nb.  New variable, `print-completions-horizontally', which causes completion\n    matches to be displayed across the screen (like `ls -x') rather than up\n    and down the screen (like `ls').\n\nc.  New variable, `completion-ignore-case', which causes filename completion\n    and matching to be performed case-insensitively.\n\nd.  There is a new bindable command, `magic-space', which causes history\n    expansion to be performed on the current readline buffer and a space to\n    be inserted into the result.\n\ne.  There is a new bindable command, `menu-complete', which enables tcsh-like\n    menu completion (successive executions of menu-complete insert a single\n    completion match, cycling through the list of possible completions).\n\nf.  There is a new bindable command, `paste-from-clipboard', for use on Win32\n    systems, to insert the text from the Win32 clipboard into the editing\n    buffer.\n\ng.  The key sequence translation code now understands printf-style backslash\n    escape sequences, including \\NNN octal escapes.  These escape sequences\n    may be used in key sequence definitions or macro values.\n\nh.  An `$include' inputrc file parser directive has been added.\n",
