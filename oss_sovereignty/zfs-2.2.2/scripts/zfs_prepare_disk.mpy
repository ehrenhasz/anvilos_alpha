For example, users can add lines to this\n# script to do things like update the drive's firmware or check the drive's\n# health.  The script is optional and can be removed if it is not needed.\n#\n# See the zfs_prepare_disk(8) man page for details.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# echo \"Prepare disk $VDEV_PATH ($VDEV_UPATH) for $VDEV_PREPARE in $POOL_NAME\"\n#\n\nexit 0\n",
