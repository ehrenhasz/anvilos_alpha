\u2026\n.Ar filesystem\n.Xc\nCreates a new ZFS file system.\nThe file system is automatically mounted according to the\n.Sy mountpoint\nproperty inherited from the parent, unless the\n.Fl u\noption is used.\n.Bl -tag -width \"-o\"\n.It Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value\nSets the specified property as if the command\n.Nm zfs Cm set Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value\nwas invoked at the same time the dataset was created.\nAny editable ZFS property can also be set at creation time.\nMultiple\n.Fl o\noptions can be specified.\nAn error results if the same property is specified in multiple\n.Fl o\noptions.\n.It Fl p\nCreates all the non-existing parent datasets.\nDatasets created in this manner are automatically mounted according to the\n.Sy mountpoint\nproperty inherited from their parent.\nAny property specified on the command line using the\n.Fl o\noption is ignored.\nIf the target filesystem already exists, the operation completes successfully.\n.It Fl n\nDo a dry-run\n.Pq Qq No-op\ncreation.\nNo datasets will be created.\nThis is useful in conjunction with the\n.Fl v\nor\n.Fl P\nflags to validate properties that are passed via\n.Fl o\noptions and those implied by other options.\nThe actual dataset creation can still fail due to insufficient privileges or\navailable capacity.\n.It Fl P\nPrint machine-parsable verbose information about the created dataset.\nEach line

appears if the\n.Fl p\noption is used.\nThe\n.Sy property\nkey has two values, a property name that property's value.\nThe\n.Sy property\nkey may appear zero or more times, once for each property that will be set local\nto\n.Em filesystem\ndue to the use of the\n.Fl o\noption.\n.It Fl u\nDo not mount the newly created file system.\n.It Fl v\nPrint verbose information about the created

volume is exported as a block device in\n.Pa /dev/zvol/path ,\nwhere\n.Em path\nis the name of the volume in the ZFS namespace.\nThe size represents the logical size as exported by the device.\nBy default, a reservation of equal size is created.\n.Pp\n.Ar size\nis automatically rounded up to the nearest multiple of the\n.Sy blocksize .\n.Bl -tag -width \"-b\"\n.It Fl b Ar blocksize\nEquivalent to\n.Fl o Sy volblocksize Ns = Ns Ar blocksize .\nIf this option is specified in conjunction with\n.Fl o Sy volblocksize ,\nthe resulting behavior is undefined.\n.It Fl o Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value\nSets the specified property as if the\n.Nm zfs Cm set Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value\ncommand was invoked at the same time the dataset was created.\nAny editable ZFS property can also be set at creation time.\nMultiple\n.Fl o\noptions can be specified.\nAn error results if the same property is specified in multiple\n.Fl o\noptions.\n.It Fl p\nCreates all the non-existing parent datasets.\nDatasets created in this manner are automatically mounted according to the\n.Sy mountpoint\nproperty inherited from their parent.\nAny property specified on the command line using the\n.Fl

Properties\nsection of\n.Xr zfsprops 7\nfor more information about sparse volumes.\n.It Fl n\nDo a dry-run\n.Pq Qq No-op\ncreation.\nNo datasets will be created.\nThis is useful in conjunction with

o\noptions, as well as\n.Sy refreservation\nif the volume is not sparse.\n.It Fl v\nPrint verbose information about the created dataset.\n.El\n.El\n.Ss ZFS for Swap\nSwapping to a ZFS volume is prone to deadlock and not recommended.\nSee OpenZFS FAQ.\n.Pp\nSwapping to a file on a ZFS filesystem is not supported.\n.\n.Sh EXAMPLES\n.\\\" These are, respectively, examples 1, 10 from zfs.8\n.\\\" Make sure to update them bidirectionally\n.Ss Example 1 : No Creating a ZFS File System Hierarchy\nThe following commands create a file system named\n.Ar pool/home\nand a file system named\n.Ar pool/home/bob .\nThe mount point\n.Pa /export/home\nis set for the parent file system, and is automatically inherited by the child\nfile system.\n.Dl # Nm zfs Cm create Ar pool/home\n.Dl # Nm zfs Cm set Sy mountpoint Ns = Ns Ar /export/home pool/home\n.Dl # Nm zfs Cm create Ar pool/home/bob\n.\n.Ss Example 2 : No Promoting a ZFS Clone\nThe following commands illustrate how to test out changes to a file system, and\nthen replace the original file system with the changed one, using clones, clone\npromotion, and renaming:\n.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds\n.No # Nm zfs Cm create Ar pool/project/production\n  populate /pool/project/production with data\n.No # Nm zfs Cm snapshot Ar pool/project/production Ns @ Ns Ar today\n.No # Nm zfs Cm clone Ar pool/project/production@today pool/project/beta\n  make changes to /pool/project/beta and test them\n.No # Nm zfs Cm promote Ar pool/project/beta\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Ar pool/project/production pool/project/legacy\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Ar pool/project/beta pool/project/production\n  once the legacy version is no longer needed, it can be destroyed\n.No # Nm zfs Cm destroy Ar pool/project/legacy\n.Ed\n.\n.Sh SEE ALSO\n.Xr
