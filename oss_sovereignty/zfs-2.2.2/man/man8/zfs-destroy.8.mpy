Nm zfs Cm snapshot Fl r Ar pool/home Ns @ Ns Ar yesterday\n.Dl # Nm zfs Cm destroy Fl r Ar pool/home Ns @ Ns Ar yesterday\n.\n.Ss Example 2 : No Promoting a ZFS Clone\nThe following commands illustrate how to test out changes to a file system, and\nthen replace the original file system with the changed one, using clones, clone\npromotion, and renaming:\n.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds\n.No # Nm zfs Cm create Ar pool/project/production\n  populate /pool/project/production with data\n.No # Nm zfs Cm snapshot Ar pool/project/production Ns @ Ns Ar today\n.No # Nm zfs Cm clone Ar pool/project/production@today pool/project/beta\n  make changes to /pool/project/beta and test them\n.No # Nm zfs Cm promote Ar pool/project/beta\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Ar pool/project/production pool/project/legacy\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Ar pool/project/beta pool/project/production\n  once the legacy version is no longer needed, it can be destroyed\n.No # Nm zfs Cm destroy Ar pool/project/legacy\n.Ed\n.\n.Ss Example 3 : No Performing a Rolling Snapshot\nThe following example shows how to maintain a history of snapshots with a\nconsistent naming scheme.\nTo keep a week's worth of snapshots, the user destroys the oldest snapshot,\nrenames the remaining snapshots, and then creates a new snapshot, as follows:\n.Bd -literal -compact -offset Ds\n.No # Nm zfs Cm destroy Fl r Ar pool/users@7daysago\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Fl r Ar pool/users@6daysago No @ Ns Ar 7daysago\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Fl r Ar pool/users@5daysago No @ Ns Ar 6daysago\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Fl r Ar pool/users@4daysago No @ Ns Ar 5daysago\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Fl r Ar pool/users@3daysago No @ Ns Ar 4daysago\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Fl r Ar pool/users@2daysago No @ Ns Ar 3daysago\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Fl r Ar pool/users@yesterday No @ Ns Ar 2daysago\n.No # Nm zfs Cm rename Fl r Ar pool/users@today No @ Ns Ar yesterday\n.No # Nm zfs Cm snapshot Fl r Ar pool/users Ns @ Ns Ar today\n.Ed\n.\n.Sh SEE ALSO\n.Xr zfs-create 8 ,\n.Xr zfs-hold 8\n",
