types, native properties and user-defined\n.Pq or Qq user\nproperties.\nNative properties either export internal statistics or control ZFS behavior.\nIn addition, native properties are either editable or read-only.\nUser properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but you can use them to annotate\nvdevs in a way that is meaningful in your environment.\nFor more information about user properties, see the\n.Sx User Properties\nsection, below.\n.\n.Ss Native Properties\nEvery vdev has a set of properties that export statistics about the vdev\nas well as control various behaviors.\nProperties are not inherited from top-level vdevs, with the exception of\nchecksum_n, checksum_t, io_n, and io_t.\n.Pp\nThe values of numeric properties can be specified using human-readable suffixes\n.Po for example,\n.Sy k , KB , M , Gb ,\nand so forth, up to\n.Sy Z\nfor zettabyte\n.Pc .\nThe following are all valid\n.Pq and equal\nspecifications:\n.Li 1536M , 1.5g , 1.50GB .\n.Pp\nThe values of non-numeric properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase.\n.Pp\nThe following native properties consist of read-only statistics about the\nvdev.\nThese properties can not be changed.\n.Bl -tag -width \"fragmentation\"\n.It Sy capacity\nPercentage of vdev space used\n.It Sy state\nstate of this vdev such as online, faulted, or offline\n.It Sy guid\nglobally unique id of this vdev\n.It Sy asize\nThe allocable size of this vdev\n.It Sy psize\nThe physical size of this vdev\n.It Sy ashift\nThe physical sector size of this vdev expressed as the power of two\n.It Sy size\nThe total size of this vdev\n.It Sy free\nThe amount of remaining free space on this vdev\n.It Sy allocated\nThe amount of allocated space on this vdev\n.It Sy expandsize\nHow much this vdev can expand by\n.It Sy fragmentation\nPercent of fragmentation in this vdev\n.It Sy parity\nThe level of parity for this vdev\n.It Sy devid\nThe device id for this vdev\n.It Sy physpath\nThe physical path to the device\n.It Sy encpath\nThe enclosure path to the device\n.It Sy fru\nField Replacable Unit, usually a model number\n.It Sy parent\nParent of this vdev\n.It Sy children\nComma separated list of children of this vdev\n.It Sy numchildren\nThe number of children belonging to this vdev\n.It Sy read_errors , write_errors , checksum_errors , initialize_errors\nThe number of errors of each type encountered by this vdev\n.It Sy null_ops , read_ops , write_ops , free_ops , claim_ops , trim_ops\nThe number of I/O operations of each type performed by this vdev\n.It Xo\n.Sy null_bytes , read_bytes , write_bytes , free_bytes , claim_bytes ,\n.Sy trim_bytes\n.Xc\nThe cumulative size of all operations of each type performed by this vdev\n.It Sy removing\nIf this device is currently being removed from the pool\n.El\n.Pp\nThe following native properties can be used to change the behavior of a vdev.\n.Bl -tag -width \"allocating\"\n.It Sy checksum_n , checksum_t , io_n , io_t\nTune the fault management daemon by specifying checksum/io thresholds of <N>\nerrors in <T> seconds, respectively.\nThese properties can be set on leaf and top-level vdevs.\nWhen the property is set on the leaf and top-level vdev, the value of the leaf\nvdev will be used.\nIf the property is only set on the top-level vdev, this value will be used.\nThe value of these properties do not persist across vdev replacement.\nFor this reason, it is advisable to set the property on the top-level vdev -\nnot on the leaf vdev itself.\nThe default values are 10 errors in 600 seconds.\n.It Sy comment\nA text comment up to 8192 characters long\n.It Sy bootsize\nThe amount of space to reserve for the EFI system partition\n.It Sy failfast\nIf this device should propage BIO errors back to ZFS, used to disable\nfailfast.\n.It Sy path\nThe path to the device for this vdev\n.It Sy allocating\nIf this device should perform new allocations, used to disable a device\nwhen it is scheduled for later removal.\nSee\n.Xr zpool-remove 8 .\n.El\n.Ss User Properties\nIn addition to the standard native properties, ZFS supports arbitrary user\nproperties.\nUser properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but applications or\nadministrators can use them to annotate vdevs.\n.Pp\nUser property names must contain a colon\n.Pq Qq Sy \\&:\ncharacter to distinguish them from native properties.\nThey may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation\ncharacters: colon\n.Pq Qq Sy \\&: ,\ndash\n.Pq Qq Sy - ,\nperiod\n.Pq Qq Sy \\&. ,\nand underscore\n.Pq Qq Sy _ .\nThe expected convention is that the property name is divided into two portions\nsuch as\n.Ar module : Ns Ar property ,\nbut this namespace is not enforced by ZFS.\nUser property names can be at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash\n.Pq Qq Sy - .\n.Pp\nWhen making programmatic use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use\na reversed DNS domain name for the\n.Ar module\ncomponent of property names to reduce the chance that two\nindependently-developed packages use the same property name for different\npurposes.\n.Pp\nThe values of user properties are arbitrary strings and\nare never validated.\nUse the\n.Nm zpool Cm set\ncommand with a blank value to clear a user property.\nProperty values are limited to 8192 bytes.\n.Sh SEE ALSO\n.Xr zpoolprops 7 ,\n.Xr zpool-set 8\n",
