Under this mode, the search path can be controlled by the\n# ZPOOL_IMPORT_PATH variable and a list of pools that should not be imported\n# can be listed in the ZFS_POOL_EXCEPTIONS variable.\n#\n# Note that importing all visible pools may include pools that you don't\n# expect, such as those on removable devices and SANs, and those pools may\n# proceed to mount themselves in places you do not want them to.
