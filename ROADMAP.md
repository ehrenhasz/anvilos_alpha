# PROJECT ANVILOS_ALPHA: SOVEREIGN ROADMAP

> **PRIME DIRECTIVE:** The Anvil is Law. We are currently in **PHASE 4 (BARE METAL)**.
> All previous phases (Mainframe, Monolith, Transmutation) are COMPLETE and LOCKED.
> We are now forging the Zero-C Unikernel Substrate.

## PHASE 1: THE MAINFRAME (ORCHESTRATION) [COMPLETE]
- [x] **Cortex:** `cortex.db` schema active (Stack, Telemetry).
- [x] **Daemons:** `architect_daemon` and `processor_daemon` active.
- [x] **Protocol:** MicroJSON (RFC-0058) established.
- [x] **Interface:** Mainframe Monitor (TUI) active.

## PHASE 2: THE MONOLITH (INFRASTRUCTURE) [COMPLETE]
- [x] **Kernel:** Linux 6.6.14 (Sovereign Build) forged.
- [x] **Userland:** Busybox 1.36.1 (Static) + ZFS 2.2.2 (Static) forged.
- [x] **ISO:** `anvilos-phase2.iso` (v0.1.0) successfully booted.

## PHASE 3: THE TRANSMUTATION (POPULATION) [COMPLETE]
- [x] **Law:** Python source (`.py`) transmuted to Anvil Bytecode (`.anv`).
- [x] **Population:** 19 Sovereign Artifacts embedded in ISO.
- [x] **Verification:** Massive Granularity (107k cards) complete.

## PHASE 4: THE SUBSTRATE (BARE METAL / UNIKERNEL) [IN PROGRESS]
**Objective:** Eliminate the heavy Linux Kernel dependency. Forge a "Zero-C" assembly substrate that boots directly into the Anvil Runtime (`mpy-cross` generated bytecode).
- [ ] **Objective 1 (The Seed):** Create `substrate.S` (Minimal x86_64 Entry).
- [ ] **Objective 2 (The Soil):** Compile `anvil_unikernel` using Sovereign Toolchain (musl-gcc).
- [ ] **Objective 3 (The Law):** Pack `synapse.anv` and `init.anv` into a raw payload.
- [ ] **Objective 4 (The World):** Generate `anvilos_v0.4.0.iso` using GRUB2 (Multiboot).
- [ ] **Objective 5 (The Breath):** Boot in QEMU. Verify "Hello Anvil" from bare metal.

## PHASE 5: THE CRYSTAL PALACE (PURE PYTHON USERLAND) [PENDING]
**Objective:** A window manager and user environment written 100% in Anvil Law.

**LEGACY ARCHIVE:**
* Old "Monitor" Phase 4 is merged into Phase 1.
* Old "Supply Chain" Phase 1.5 is merged into Phase 2.
